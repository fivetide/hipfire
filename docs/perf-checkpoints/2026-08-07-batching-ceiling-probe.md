# 2026-08-07 — Batching-ceiling probe (Task 0 / SP1 Task 1)

Empirical check of the spec §8 bandwidth-roofline estimates (~3.3× aggregate
speedup for the 27B dense model, ~1.8× for the 35B-A3B MoE) before any batched
kernel code is written. Method, tool, and results below; verdict at the end.

## What this measures — and what it does not

`probe_batching_ceiling.rs` calls `attention_flash_q8_0_batched_masked`
`layers` times at batch 1, across four context lengths, and fits
`t(ctx) = a + b·ctx` by least squares. This is **the attention/KV term only**.
It is not a decode step of a real model: no DeltaNet layers, no dense
projections, no MoE router/expert gather, no embedding lookup. SP1 does not
run a full model forward, so the "weights" side of the roofline argument is
**inferred from the spec's byte accounting, not measured here**. Anything
below labelled a "predicted speedup" is an extrapolation of the attention
kernel's own timing model, not an end-to-end number — see the verdict section
for why that distinction is load-bearing to the conclusion.

## Method

- Whole-step wall time only: one `Instant::now()` before `layers` un-synced
  kernel launches, one `device_synchronize()` after, per timed iteration.
  **No per-operation `device_synchronize`** — that would fabricate GPU
  speedups and corrupt the slope fit (see brief and inline kernel comments).
- 3 warmup iterations (untimed, synced once after), 9 timed iterations,
  median reported (not mean) to resist outliers.
- K/V cache filled with a fixed synthetic Q8_0 pattern (scale=1.0, small code
  ramp) — not numerically meaningful, this is a timing probe, not a
  correctness test.
- Context lengths: 4096, 16384, 32768, 65536 (`CTXS` default).

## Commands run

```bash
# 35B-A3B shape (defaults: NH=16 NKV=2 HD=256 LAYERS=10)

```

Hardware: gfx1151 (Strix Halo, Radeon 8060S iGPU, dev box). The deployment
target is gfx1201 (R9700), which we do not have — absolute numbers below are
dev-hardware only; only the *shape* of the fit (sign and relative magnitude of
`b`) is expected to transfer.

Each shape was run twice to check stability before writing this note.

## Results — 35B-A3B shape (NH=16 NKV=2 HD=256 LAYERS=10)

| ctx | median_ms (run 1) | median_ms (run 2) |
|---|---|---|
| 4,096 | 0.914 | 0.924 |
| 16,384 | 2.888 | 2.969 |
| 32,768 | 6.797 | 6.834 |
| 65,536 | 14.146 | 14.344 |

Fit (run 1, used as canonical below): `t(ctx) = -0.3218 ms + 0.219151 ms/1K ctx`
Fit (run 2, reproducibility check): `t(ctx) = -0.3223 ms + 0.221924 ms/1K ctx`

- `a` (context-independent term in this probe): **-0.32 ms** — see "Reading
  the negative `a`" below; this is not the model's real weights term.
- `b` (KV/attention term, does not amortise across slots): **~0.220 ms per 1K
  ctx**, stable across reruns to <2%.

## Results — 27B dense shape (NH=24 NKV=4 HD=256 LAYERS=16)

| ctx | median_ms (run 1) | median_ms (run 2) |
|---|---|---|
| 4,096 | 1.661 | 1.708 |
| 16,384 | 7.774 | 7.719 |
| 32,768 | 14.897 | 15.193 |
| 65,536 | 31.222 | 32.247 |

Fit (run 1, canonical): `t(ctx) = -0.3379 ms + 0.479062 ms/1K ctx`
Fit (run 2, reproducibility check): `t(ctx) = -0.5289 ms + 0.496553 ms/1K ctx`

- `a`: **-0.34 ms** (run 1) / -0.53 ms (run 2) — same near-zero-negative
  pattern as the 35B shape, larger absolute jitter because this shape's `layers`
  (16) and per-layer bytes are both bigger, so the fixed 4-point fit has more
  leverage from the same relative timer noise.
- `b`: **~0.479-0.497 ms per 1K ctx**, i.e. **~2.2× steeper** than the 35B
  shape's `b`. Spec §8 gives the 27B moving 32 KB/token against the 35B's
  10 KB/token — a 3.2× byte ratio. The measured slope ratio (~2.2×) is in the
  same direction (noticeably steeper, as the brief predicted) but shallower
  than the raw byte ratio, most likely because the 27B shape's larger
  `n_heads`/`n_kv_heads` (24/4 vs 16/2) also means more parallel work per tile,
  so the kernel is not purely bandwidth-bound at these shapes on gfx1151.

Both shapes: `b` positive, growing with context, reproducible across reruns.
This is the pass condition in the brief — a near-zero or negative `b` would
have meant the kernel wasn't reading the full context; that did not happen
here.

## Reading the negative `a`

The brief's stated failure condition is `b` near zero or negative; that did
not occur, so the probe is not BLOCKED. But `a` came out small and negative in
every run (both shapes, both reruns), which is worth explaining rather than
silently reporting.

This probe runs **only** the attention kernel — no weights are loaded, no
dense/DeltaNet/MoE compute happens. So the "context-independent" intercept
here is not a stand-in for the model's real weights term; it is just whatever
fixed per-call overhead (kernel dispatch, argument marshalling) the attention
launch itself carries, extrapolated back to `ctx=0` by a 4-point least-squares
fit. That overhead is small (sub-millisecond) and, with only 4 unevenly-scaled
sample points and a relation that is not perfectly affine (the 4096-ctx point
runs slightly more expensive per-token than the trend, likely fixed
tile/launch overhead dominating at small ctx), the fit can — and reproducibly
does — land marginally on the negative side of zero. This is fit noise around
a true value near zero, not evidence of negative-time execution.

The practical consequence: **this probe's own N=2/4/8 "speedup" formula
(below) is not a valid proxy for end-to-end batching benefit**, because the
whole benefit in that formula comes from amortising `a` across slots, and this
`a` is not the real weights term (see "Verdict" below).

## Predicted speedups from this probe's own fit (attention-term-only — NOT end-to-end)

Using `seq = N·(a + b·ctx)`, `batched = a + N·b·ctx`, `speedup = seq/batched`,
with each shape's own canonical (run 1) fit:

### 35B-A3B (a=-0.3218, b=0.000219151 ms/ctx)

| N | ctx | seq (ms) | batched (ms) | speedup |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 4,096 | 1.152 | 1.473 | 0.78× |
| 2 | 16,384 | 6.537 | 6.859 | 0.95× |
| 2 | 32,768 | 13.719 | 14.040 | 0.98× |

| 4 | 65,536 | 56.162 | 57.127 | 0.98× |
| 8 | 4,096 | 4.606 | 6.859 | 0.67× |
| 8 | 16,384 | 26.150 | 28.403 | 0.92× |

| 8 | 65,536 | 112.323 | 114.576 | 0.98× |

### 27B dense (a=-0.3379, b=0.000479062 ms/ctx)

| N | ctx | seq (ms) | batched (ms) | speedup |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 4,096 | 3.249 | 3.587 | 0.91× |
| 2 | 16,384 | 15.022 | 15.360 | 0.98× |
| 2 | 32,768 | 30.720 | 31.058 | 0.99× |
| 2 | 65,536 | 62.116 | 62.454 | 0.99× |
| 4 | 4,096 | 6.497 | 7.511 | 0.87× |
| 4 | 16,384 | 30.044 | 31.058 | 0.97× |
| 4 | 32,768 | 61.440 | 62.454 | 0.98× |
| 4 | 65,536 | 124.232 | 125.245 | 0.99× |
| 8 | 4,096 | 12.995 | 15.360 | 0.85× |
| 8 | 16,384 | 60.088 | 62.454 | 0.96× |
| 8 | 32,768 | 122.880 | 125.245 | 0.98× |
| 8 | 65,536 | 248.463 | 250.829 | 0.99× |

Every one of these is **below 1.0×** — the formula says batching this
attention-only proxy is never a win. Do not read that as "batching hurts";
read it as the formula having nothing to amortise. `a·(1−N)` is the entire
numerator of the gap between `seq` and `batched`, and `a` here is ≈0 (slightly
negative). With no real weights term in the model, there is no amortisable
cost for batching to recover — this table demonstrates the mechanism (KV never
amortises) far more than it demonstrates a number.

## Verdict: does spec §8's ~3.3× (27B) / ~1.8× (35B) survive?

**Not confirmed, not refuted — correctly out of reach of this probe, as
designed.** Spec §8's aggregate speedup comes overwhelmingly from amortising
the *weights* term (~15 GB/step for the 27B; ~1.2 GB dense + ~2.2 GB experts
for the 35B) across N slots, with the KV term as the drag that erodes it at
long context. This probe deliberately does not load any weights (SP1 does not
run a full model forward — that is explicitly future work), so it cannot
measure the numerator that drives those ratios. Nothing here contradicts
§8's ~3.3×/~1.8×.

What this probe **does** establish, which §8 could only assume before now:

1. **The structural premise holds.** `b > 0` and growing with `ctx` in both
   shapes, reproducibly. The KV/attention term is real, it scales with
   context as expected, and the kernel is demonstrably reading the full
   context (the failure mode the brief warned about — `b` near zero or
   negative — did not occur).
2. **The 27B really does move more KV traffic per token than the 35B-A3B**,
   directionally consistent with spec's 32 KB vs 10 KB claim: measured `b` is
   ~2.2× steeper for the 27B shape, versus a 3.2× byte-ratio prediction. The
   shortfall from 3.2× to 2.2× is itself useful: it says the naive
   bytes-per-token arithmetic in §8 mildly *overstates* how much worse the
   27B's KV term is relative to the 35B's, at least on gfx1151 at these head
   counts — plausibly because the 27B's larger head count (24 vs 16) gives the
   kernel more parallel work per KV tile, so it is not purely bandwidth-bound
   here. That is a data point for tuning (§10's `TILE_SIZE`/BR/BC sweep), not
   a refutation of the aggregate ratio.
3. **The real weights term (`a`) still needs to be measured or at minimum
   estimated from a real forward pass**, not just inferred from bandwidth
   arithmetic, before the aggregate 3.3×/1.8× figures can be trusted. This
   probe's near-zero fitted `a` should not be confused with that term — it is
   attention-launch overhead, not model weights.

**Recommendation:** the 8 downstream SP1 tasks are not invalidated by
anything found here — the KV-term half of the roofline argument survives
contact with measurement. But before treating 3.3×/1.8× as load-bearing
product numbers (e.g. for the "3-4 agents on one R9700" framing), a follow-up
probe that actually loads real weights and runs a genuine decode step (even
single-layer-representative, not full model) is needed to pin down `a`. That
is a natural Task 0.5, not blocking for SP1's kernel work, which only needs
the KV term's structural behaviour (confirmed here) to proceed.

## Reproducibility

Both shapes were run twice; `b` was stable to <2% across reruns for the 35B
shape and ~4% for the 27B shape (larger jitter attributable to more `layers`
× larger per-layer bytes amplifying the same relative timer noise across a
4-point fit). `a` stayed small and negative in all four runs. See the raw
tables above for both runs' `median_ms` values.

## Addendum: achieved memory bandwidth — the actionable finding

Neither the probe's own output nor the verdict above computed what the kernel
actually achieves against the memory bus. Doing so changes the conclusion, so
it is recorded here.

Bytes moved per timed iteration are exactly known: `layers × ctx ×
n_kv_heads × (head_dim/32) × 34 × 2` (K and V, Q8_0 = 34 B per 32 values).

| shape | ctx | KV read | time | achieved | % of 256 GB/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 35B-A3B | 4,096 | 44.6 MB | 0.914 ms | 48.8 GB/s | 19.0% |
| 35B-A3B | 16,384 | 178.3 MB | 2.888 ms | 61.7 GB/s | 24.1% |
| 35B-A3B | 32,768 | 356.5 MB | 6.797 ms | 52.5 GB/s | 20.5% |
| 35B-A3B | 65,536 | 713.0 MB | 14.146 ms | 50.4 GB/s | 19.7% |
| 27B | 4,096 | 142.6 MB | 1.661 ms | 85.9 GB/s | 33.5% |
| 27B | 16,384 | 570.4 MB | 7.774 ms | 73.4 GB/s | 28.7% |
| 27B | 32,768 | 1140.9 MB | 14.897 ms | 76.6 GB/s | 29.9% |
| 27B | 65,536 | 2281.7 MB | 31.222 ms | 73.1 GB/s | 28.5% |

**At batch 1 the attention kernel sustains roughly 20-24% (35B shape) and
28-34% (27B shape) of the 256 GB/s bus.** Crucially the figure is *flat*
across a 16× context range. If this were launch or fixed-overhead bound,
utilisation would climb with context; it does not. This is a sustained
kernel-efficiency ceiling at batch 1, not a small-size artifact.

### Why this matters more than the fit

Spec §8 argues that KV reads "never amortise across slots" and therefore cap
the batching win. That is true in **bytes** and false in **time**. Four slots
must read 4× the KV bytes — but at batch 1 we are 3-5× below the roofline, so
those 4× bytes need not cost 4× the time. Batching supplies exactly what a
memory system needs to close such a gap: more independent requests in flight.

This makes spec §8's estimate **pessimistic about the attention term**, and it
raises rather than lowers the expected value of SP1. It converts the central
question from "how much does the non-amortising KV term erode the win" into a
measurable one: **how much of that 3-5× headroom does batching recover?**
Task 8's batched-vs-sequential sweep answers it directly.

### It also explains the 2.2× vs 3.2× slope shortfall

The 27B shape moves 3.2× the KV bytes per token of the 35B shape but its
fitted slope is only ~2.2× steeper. The bandwidth table shows why: the 27B
shape runs at ~29% utilisation against the 35B's ~20%, because `n_kv_heads=4`
vs `2` gives each workgroup more contiguous KV per position. Being closer to
the roofline, its extra bytes cost proportionally less time. The two
observations are the same fact seen twice, and the earlier "more parallel work
per KV tile" hypothesis is confirmed by the numbers.

### Caveat on the denominator

256 GB/s is the Ryzen AI Max+ 395's theoretical LPDDR5X-8000 figure. The iGPU
cannot necessarily reach it. A BabelStream run (`~/repos/BabelStream`) would
pin the achievable ceiling and turn these percentages from indicative into
exact. Until then, read them as "far below roofline", not as precise
efficiency figures. The flatness across context is the robust part and does
not depend on the denominator.

---

## Addendum 2: the bandwidth denominator, measured

The addendum above divided by 256 GB/s — the Ryzen AI Max+ 395's *theoretical*
LPDDR5X-8000 figure — and flagged that the iGPU may not reach it. It does not.
BabelStream (`~/repos/BabelStream/build/hip-stream`, 268 MB arrays, 5 reps,
device "AMD Radeon 8060S"):

| kernel | GB/s |
|---|---|
| Copy | 239.3 |
| Mul | 233.9 |
| Add | 225.6 |
| **Triad** | **223.9** |
| Dot | 221.1 |

So achievable is **~224-239 GB/s**, i.e. 87-93% of theoretical. Recomputing the
attention kernel's utilisation against Triad (223.9, the conservative choice —
attention is read-dominated, so the Copy figure of 239.3 is arguably the fairer
ceiling and would make utilisation look *worse*, not better):

| shape | ctx | achieved | % of Triad | headroom |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 35B-A3B | 4,096 | 48.8 | 21.8% | 4.6× |
| 35B-A3B | 16,384 | 61.7 | 27.6% | 3.6× |
| 35B-A3B | 32,768 | 52.5 | 23.4% | 4.3× |
| 35B-A3B | 65,536 | 50.4 | 22.5% | 4.4× |
| 27B | 4,096 | 85.9 | 38.4% | 2.6× |
| 27B | 16,384 | 73.4 | 32.8% | 3.1× |
| 27B | 32,768 | 76.6 | 34.2% | 2.9× |
| 27B | 65,536 | 73.1 | 32.6% | 3.1× |

**The headroom claim is now measured rather than indicative: ~2.6-3.1× on the
27B shape and ~3.6-4.6× on the 35B-A3B shape**, against a ceiling established
on the same device with the same allocator. The earlier "3-5×" was close and
slightly optimistic on the 27B side.

Note the ordering: the 35B shape has *more* headroom precisely because it is
*further* from the roofline (`n_kv_heads=2` gives each workgroup less contiguous
KV per position than the 27B's 4). Whether batching converts headroom into
throughput is what Task 8 measures; this only establishes that the headroom is
real and quantified.
