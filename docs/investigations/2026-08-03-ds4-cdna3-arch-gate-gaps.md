# DeepSeek-V4 on CDNA3 (gfx942): the missing-arch-gate defect class

*2026-08-03 · branch `ds4-cdna-test-fail` · MI300X VF, gfx942, HIP 7.0 / ROCm core-7.14*

## Summary

Bringing DeepSeek-V4 up on MI300X surfaced **five** instances of one defect
class: a wave32-WMMA kernel reachable on CDNA3 with no architecture predicate.
Because `__builtin_amdgcn_wmma_*_w32` requires `gfx11-insts,wavefrontsize32`,
these do not degrade — they fail to **compile**, so the failure lands at JIT in
the middle of a forward pass rather than at model load.

Three are fixed. Two are open, and one of them blocks all batched/long-context
prefill on gfx942.

| # | kernel | status | commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `gemm_f16_x_f16_wmma` (F16 compressor path) | FIXED — new wave64 MFMA port | `398c3d176` |
| 2 | `gemm_hfq4g256_wmma` | FIXED — gated on `has_wmma()`, falls to `gemm_hfq4g256` | `692ee9ab6` |
| 3 | `gemm_q8_0_batched` / `wo_per_group_batched_q8_0_1w` | OPEN — no CDNA3 kernel exists; instrumented | `23de0d081` |
| 4 | `gemm_mq2g256_lloyd_moe_grouped_wmma_k2` | OPEN — blocks batched prefill | — |
| 5 | grouped-MoE MFMA path is dead code | OPEN — faults when enabled | — |

`crates/rdna-compute/src/arch_caps.rs:124-126` defines `has_wmma()` as
`is_rdna3 || is_rdna4`, so it is correctly false on CDNA3. The bug is never the
predicate — it is call sites that do not consult one.

## The 3x trunk gap (root-caused)

Same harness, same prompt (md5 `70dd00052d9ff000`), same binary, back to back,
`dspark_bench --AR`, 64 tokens:

```
MQ2R      31.78 tok/s   (repeat 31.77, 31.80)
MQ2-Lloyd 10.62 tok/s   (repeat 10.63)      -> 2.99x
```

Independently corroborated by the DSpark block controller's own fitted cost
model (`crates/hipfire-runtime/src/dspark_block_controller.rs:160-163`):
`t_ar` = 35.5 ms on MQ2R vs 100.1 ms on MQ2-Lloyd.

Per-kernel attribution via `profile_prefill_deepseek4` after adding the missing
timers (`--prefill 13 --warmup 4 --gen 8`):

```
MQ2-Lloyd                                       calls   total_us   GiB/s     %
  gemm_q8_0_batched                               344   174827.3    24.6  68.5
  ...lloyd_moe_gate_up_indexed_batched_k4          43    26992.0   549.9  10.6
  gemv_mq2g256_lloyd_moe_down_expanded_k4          43    14423.0   516.3   5.7
  wo_per_group_batched_q8_0_1w                     43    12782.3   117.0   5.0
  gemm_f16_x_f16_mfma_gfx942                      166    11964.9    77.9   4.7
  TOTAL 255219.9 us

MQ2R: neither Q8 kernel present.  TOTAL 57905.8 us
```

**The two Q8 kernels are 73.5% of MQ2-Lloyd kernel time.**

The decisive datum is intra-process and therefore cannot be attributed to
bandwidth, clocks, or the artifact: in the *same capture on the same GPU*, the
routed-expert GEMVs sustain **549.9 GiB/s** while `gemm_q8_0_batched` manages
**24.6 GiB/s** — a 22x spread between two kernels in one profile.

Cause: MQ2-Lloyd ships hot dense projections as qt=3 **Q8_0**; MQ2R ships the
same tensors as qt=35 **MFP4G32E8SOA** (enforced by the loader at
`crates/hipfire-arch-deepseek4/src/arch.rs:708-710`). Routed experts are qt=19
MQ2-Lloyd in **both** artifacts and take identical kernels — MoE is *not* the
differentiator. There is **no Q8 MFMA kernel anywhere in the tree**, so on CDNA3
every Q8_0 dense weight lands on a scalar kernel launched with block `[32,1,1]`
— a 32-thread workgroup on native wave64, half of every wave idle — plus
byte-wide loads on 34-byte strides and a `float sums[64]` accumulator
predicated 64 ways per weight byte although AR decode only uses `b=0`
(`kernels/src/gemm_q8_0_batched.hip:22-29,41-60`).

### Fix shape (not yet built)

`gemm_q8_0_batched.gfx942.hip`: native wave64, `n==1` specialization (no
`MAX_BATCH` array or predication), coalesced dword loads instead of byte loads,
several output rows per wave. MFMA is not required — at B=1 this is
memory-bound; the win is lane utilization and load width. Same treatment for
`wo_per_group_batched_q8_0`. Iterate against a standalone kernel microbench at
the real shapes, not 3-minute model loads.

## Open gap 4/5: batched MoE prefill is broken on gfx942

Any prefill with `pp_batch` large enough to take the grouped MoE path dies:

```
ffn_batched l0 dispatch: hipcc compilation failed for
gemm_mq2g256_lloyd_moe_grouped_wmma_k2 ... needs gfx11-insts,wavefrontsize32
```

B=1 AR decode never reaches it, which is why `dspark_bench` runs fine. This
blocks the long-context work outright — no prefill, no context ladder.

A CDNA3 replacement already exists and is fully wired:
`kernels/src/gemm_mq2g256_lloyd_moe_grouped_mfma.gfx942.hip`, binding
`gemm_mq2g256_lloyd_moe_grouped_mfma_gfx942`, dispatch arm
`GroupedLloydVariant::MfmaGfx942` (`crates/hipfire-dispatch/src/pipeline/mod.rs:1518`),
and top priority in `select_grouped_lloyd_variant` (`:1462`).

**It is dead code.** Both call sites (`:1764` gate_up, `:1832` down) pass a
literal `false` for the `mfma_gfx942` argument, so the variant can never be
chosen.

Passing `gpu.arch.starts_with("gfx942")` instead clears the compile failure and
then faults:

```
htod n_active_topk_arr: HipError(700): illegal memory access
```

HIP 700 on a memcpy is a sticky deferred fault from an earlier async kernel, so
the MFMA kernel itself is faulting. Grid geometry is **not** the cause — both
variants use `row_tiles=(m+15)/16`, `slot_tiles=(m_total+15)/16` and both call
`ensure_fp16_x`, so the tile contract matches. Leading suspect: the kernel reads
`expert_tile_ids[blockIdx.y]` and guards only `expert_id < 0`, then dereferences
`expert_weight_ptrs[expert_id]` with no upper bound
(`gemm_mq2g256_lloyd_moe_grouped_mfma.gfx942.hip:34-35,46-47`); a stale tile id
>= n_experts yields a garbage pointer. **Unconfirmed** — needs a semantic diff
against the WMMA kernel plus on-hardware iteration.

The enablement was deliberately **not** landed: a clean compile-time refusal is
safer than an illegal memory access, which had already corrupted the rocBLAS
handle by teardown.

## Scope note: what this is and is not worth

These fixes are **CDNA3-only**. gfx1151 already has purpose-built fast paths for
every kernel above — `gemm_q8_0_mmq_4w.gfx1151.hip`,
`wo_per_group_batched_q8_0_wmma_4w` (gfx1151-gated at
`crates/rdna-compute/src/gemv.rs:10886`), and 12 further Q8 WMMA kernels. None
of this work advances the Strix Halo long-context goal directly.

MI300X is also a poor performance proxy for Strix Halo: ~5.3 TB/s HBM3 against
~256 GB/s LPDDR5X unified [spec, unmeasured here] inverts most bandwidth-bound
conclusions. Its unique value is capacity and turnaround — long-context
coherence probes, memory-model validation at 1M, and reference-output
generation — none of which is reachable until gap 4 is closed.

## Also settled

- **MQ2R DSpark works — the restamp was never the problem.** *(Supersedes an
  earlier conclusion in this document, and two records in the tree.)* A sidecar
  stamped via `scripts/reap/hfq_metadata_stamp.rs` initially accepted **0 of
  87** drafts (tau 1.016), matching the historical gfx1151 result (0 of 89).
  That was blamed on the artifact. It was a **missing `match` arm**:
  `dspark_core::gemv_auto_batched_wmma` had arms for F32/Q8_0/F16 and a
  catch-all `_` that decodes everything else as HFQ4-G256, while MQ2R's trunk
  head — which the draft lm_head is bound from — is qt=35 MFP4G32E8SOA. E8-SoA
  bytes decoded as HFQ4-G256 produce garbage draft logits, and
  `accept_greedy_prefix` (`crates/hipfire-runtime/src/spec.rs:149-178`) is exact
  u32 equality, so every draft lost. Fixed in `c420159e2`:

  ```
                    before          after
    accept          0.000 (0/87)    0.582 (32/55)
    tau             1.016           2.065
    DSpark tok/s    19.13           34.70
    AR control      31.78           31.84      -> 1.09x
  ```

  0.582 is the **highest acceptance measured in any configuration**, above
  MQ2-Lloyd's 0.515 on the same sidecar bytes — the expected ordering, since
  MQ2R is the better-calibrated target. Decoded output is coherent and matches
  AR but for one near-tie word.

  Two records in the tree are therefore **misattributed** and should be
  revisited: `registry/deepseek4-mq2r-gfx1151-v2.json` marks the artifact class
  `rejected_mq2lloyd_payload_diagnostic_only`, and
  `docs/specs/2026-07-23-deepseek4-mq2r-e8-recipe.md` records a rejected restamp
  at 7.92 tok/s vs 30.21 AR. The artifact is fine — its 2376 payload tensors are
  recipe-agnostic Q8/F16 (`scripts/quantize-dspark.sh`, `--format
  deepseek4-q8-mtp`). Because the defect is recipe-driven and arch-independent,
  the July gfx1151 measurement is very likely the same bug, not a bad sidecar.
  Whether a *properly P3-calibrated* sidecar beats this one is now an open
  question worth asking again, on a fair basis.
- **The 0731 `-mtp` sidecars are the 3-stage DSpark module**, not MTP: stages
  `mtp.{0,1,2}`, 2376 tensors (791/789/796), no `hnorm`/`e_proj`/`h_proj`. A
  genuine MTP addon is one stage, 797 tensors, with those projections present
  (`crates/hipfire-arch-deepseek4/src/arch.rs:1638-1642`). Both 0731 sidecars
  are byte-identical, sha256 `c123b976…b248`. The quantizer should emit
  `-dspark.<ext>` directly.
- **DSpark on CDNA3 works**: 16.25 tok/s vs 10.63 AR on the MQ2-Lloyd trunk
  (1.53x), tau 2.207, accept 0.515, coherent output. But that is 1.53x on a
  3x-handicapped trunk — *half* plain AR on MQ2R. Speculation numbers measured
  on MQ2-Lloyd are not comparable to MQ2R.
- **A 4-wave K-pipelined rewrite of `gemm_f16_x_f16_mfma.gfx942.hip`** was
  bit-exact (token-identical, 3 fresh processes) but measured 16.17-16.19 vs
  16.24-16.25 tok/s — no gain, reverted. It targeted rank 5 at 4.7% of kernel
  time; the profile above is what should have been gathered first.
- **DSpark is not bit-identical to AR at greedy, and that is very likely
  expected.** On the MQ2-Lloyd trunk at temp 0.00 the two streams agree for 29
  tokens, diverge at exactly one position, then **re-synchronize**:

  ```
  AR      … 34105, 16754,                       22467, 53330, 294, 2900, 14, 1277 …
  DSpark  … 34105,   344, 1949, 850, 5379, 362, 22467, 53330, 294, 2900, 14, 1277 …
  ```

  `AR[30:36] == DSpark[34:40]` exactly. Both paths saw an **identical context**
  through index 28, so the differing argmax at 29 means the verify forward's
  logits differ from the B=1 AR forward's — a reduction-order effect of batch
  shape (AR decode is batch=1 GEMV; verify is batch=n GEMM). Two facts argue
  against an acceptance bug: accept=0.515 shows verification is actively
  rejecting rather than rubber-stamping, and a broken verifier would drift into
  different content instead of rejoining on an identical 6-token run.
  The MFMA port is **exonerated** — bypassing it entirely
  (`HIPFIRE_DEEPSEEK4_COMP_F16_WMMA=0`) yields byte-identical tokens, and the
  pipelined kernel variant reproduced the sequence exactly.
  Still **circumstantial**: forcing the DSpark block to 1 would settle it
  directly, but `HIPFIRE_DEEPSEEK4_SPEC_K` only applies to the MTP branch
  (`examples/dspark_bench.rs:208`) — DSpark takes `block` from the sidecar, so
  that test needs a code change.

## Rig fidelity: MI300X is NOT a faithful proxy for gfx1151 DSpark tuning

MI300X is used as a fast prototyping rig for gfx1151 (hours per iteration instead
of days on a Strix Halo). For that to work, conclusions must transfer. On the Q8
path they currently do **not**, in two independent ways.

Measured with `crates/rdna-compute/examples/bench_q8_0_batched.rs` (`prod` arm =
`gemm_q8_0_batched_chunked`, the entry point production calls), M=4096 K=4096,
identical binary blob `aecb1d7d…` on both boxes:

| B | 1 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 8 | 13 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gfx942 (scalar) | 1589 | 1230 | 934 | **198** | 167 | 150 | **86** |
| gfx1151 (f16 WMMA) | 202 | 368 | 352 | 352 | 349 | 358 | **364** |

GiB/s over Q8 weight bytes. Both are cache-warm (17 MiB working set), so the
ABSOLUTE numbers are not HBM-representative — the **shape** is the point.

**1. Cost curves are opposite.** gfx942 degrades 18x from B=1 to B=13; gfx1151 is
flat (0.045-0.048 ms) from B=2 to B=13, i.e. deeper drafting is nearly free on the
target. The routing that causes this: `gemm.rs:19753` returns `gemm_q8_0_wmma`
whenever `has_wmma() && k % 32 == 0`, and K%32==0 is guaranteed by the Q8_0 group
size — so gfx1151 NEVER executes the scalar kernel, and gfx942 (has_wmma false)
always does.

Consequence: the DSpark block controller fits
`t_window(n) = t_ar + (n-1)*dt` and argmaxes `tau(N)/(t_ar + N*dt)`
(`crates/hipfire-runtime/src/dspark_block_controller.rs:160-163,210-234`). The
`ratio = dt/t_ar = 0.356` measured on MQ2R/MI300X is a rig artifact: the Q8 draft
contribution to `dt` is ~0 on gfx1151 out to B=13. **Block-size tuning done on
MI300X will systematically UNDER-shoot the gfx1151 optimum.** MI300X says "keep
blocks small"; the target says "draft as deep as acceptance allows."

**2. Numerics already diverge, independent of any kernel work.**
`gemm_q8_0_wmma` does not preserve the scalar reduction order or precision, and
the tree's own parity test accepts that: `test_gemm_q8_0_wmma_parity.rs:23-25`
passes at `mean_rel < 2e-3` and `max_rel < 3.5e-2`, explicitly not bitwise. The
harness reproduces it directly — `exact = NO`, max_absdiff 1.9e-2 to 2.7e-2 on
gfx1151, versus bit-identical on gfx942 where both arms are the same kernel.
Since a flipped argmax at a near-tie is an exact-token-id rejection in the accept
path, **tau and accept measured on MI300X are rig-local**. The MQ2R accept=0.582
figure should not be quoted as a gfx1151 expectation.

### What this means for using the rig

- **Transfers:** correctness and structural fixes (the missing E8 arm in
  `c420159e2` is recipe-driven and arch-independent — it should fix gfx1151's
  historical 0-of-89 too), missing-arch-gate defects, instrumentation.
- **Does NOT transfer:** DSpark block size, confidence-truncation threshold,
  adaptive-B behaviour, and absolute tau/accept. These must be measured on
  gfx1151 itself, or the rig needs Q8 cost AND numerics parity first.
- A gfx942 Q8 kernel would fix the cost half but not the numerics half, and an
  attempt at one measured neutral (see below), so parity is not cheap.

### A rewrite that measured neutral, and was not landed

An exact-B-template wave64 port (b1..b6, killing the `MAX_BATCH=64` predicated
accumulator array, one shared `.cuh` body serving both Q8 kernels) was written,
built and measured. It was **bit-exact on every cell** and **0.87-1.01x** — no
gain. The hypothesis it was built on (VGPR pressure from the 64-accumulator
array) is refuted: VGPR allocation is compile-time fixed while `batch_size` is a
runtime argument, so the compiler could never have specialised it away, and
removing it changed nothing. A follow-up probe also refuted X-re-read traffic: at
B=6, M=1024 takes 0.089 ms vs M=4096 at 0.094 ms — near-identical wall time for
4x the output rows and 4x the weight bytes, so above B=5 the cost is essentially
M-independent. **The B=5 cliff on gfx942 remains unexplained** and is the open
question for anyone resuming this.

## The RDNA matrix — and why the CDNA3 Q8 thread is closed

`hipx` carries four RDNA generations, which makes it the real bench for "fastest
engine on RDNA":

| HIP dev | card | arch | VRAM |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | RX 7900 XTX | gfx1100 (RDNA3) | 25.8 GB |
| 1 | Radeon 8060S | gfx1151 (RDNA3.5, Strix Halo) | 103.1 GB |
| 2 | RX 5700 XT | gfx1010 (RDNA1) | 8.6 GB |
| 3 | RX 6950 XT | gfx1030 (RDNA2) | 17.2 GB |

(Note HIP device order != `rocm-smi` GPU[n] order.)

Q8_0 `prod` path (`gemm_q8_0_batched_chunked`), M=4096 K=4096, 17 MiB weights,
**ms per call** (lower better), same binary blob `aecb1d7d…`:

| arch | path | B=1 | B=2 | B=4 | B=5 | B=6 | B=8 | B=13 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gfx1151 | WMMA | 0.045 | 0.045 | 0.045 | 0.045 | 0.045 | 0.045 | 0.045 |
| gfx1100 | WMMA | 0.089 | 0.086 | 0.076 | 0.054 | 0.054 | 0.053 | 0.052 |
| gfx1030 | scalar | 0.204 | 0.259 | 0.358 | 0.409 | 0.461 | 0.599 | 0.889 |
| gfx1010 | scalar | 0.476 | 0.589 | 0.866 | 0.975 | 1.071 | 1.417 | 3.731 |
| gfx942 | scalar | 0.010 | 0.013 | 0.018 | 0.084 | 0.099 | 0.111 | 0.194 |

### 1. The gfx942 B=5 cliff is CDNA-specific — do not chase it

gfx1030 runs the SAME scalar kernel on wave32 and degrades smoothly (2.0x from
B=1 to B=5, against 5x the work — sublinear). gfx942 steps 8.4x over the same
range. The cliff is an artifact of a wave32-shaped kernel (block [32,1,1],
32-lane shfl tree) executing on wave64 hardware, not an algorithmic property.
Since CDNA3 is not a product target, this closes the Q8 CDNA3 kernel effort. The
neutral rewrite was correctly not landed.

### 2. On WMMA parts, deeper speculation is free or profitable

gfx1151 is perfectly flat B=1..13. gfx1100 gets FASTER with batch — 0.052 ms at
B=13 vs 0.089 ms at B=1 — because a 16-wide WMMA tile is 1/16 utilised at B=1.
So on RDNA3/3.5 the Q8 draft cost contributes ~0 (or negative) marginal `dt`,
and **DSpark's optimal block is bounded by ACCEPTANCE, not by cost**. Any
controller fitted on a scalar part, or on MI300X, will select blocks far too
small. This is the actionable RDNA perf lever.

Corollary: AR decode (B=1) is the WORST case on gfx1100 — single-token decode
wastes 15/16 of every WMMA tile.

### 3. gfx1100 is a valid numerics proxy for gfx1151

Both WMMA parts report IDENTICAL deviation from the scalar reference at every
batch (max_absdiff 1.932e-2, 1.937e-2, 2.419e-2 x3, 2.695e-2 x2). RDNA3 and
RDNA3.5 agree with each other exactly; only RDNA-vs-scalar differs. So short-
context correctness work can iterate on the 7900 XTX, and the 96 GiB Strix Halo
is needed only for genuinely long context.

### 4. Role of MI300X, corrected

MI300X is an ORACLE and data-generation vehicle, not a performance proxy — its
cost curve is the inverse of the targets'. Use it for PyTorch reference
generation (`crates/hipfire-arch-deepseek4/reference_oracle/`, teacher artifacts
at `/mnt/scratch/quantization/deepseek-v4-flash-0731-teacher/`), long-context
ground truth, and calibration compute. Do NOT use it to tune block size,
thresholds, or to quote tau/accept.

## CONFIRMED ON TARGET: MQ2R DSpark ACCEPTS on gfx1151 (correctness, not a perf claim)

The E8 draft-head fix (`c420159e2`) was predicted to transfer, because it is
recipe-driven and architecture-independent. **It does** — as a correctness
result. The throughput figure below is harness-local and must NOT be quoted as a
production speedup; see the correction at the end of this section.

gfx1151 (Radeon 8060S / Strix Halo, HIP device 1), 0731 MQ2R trunk
(sha256 `cbf2bbcf…8cce`, verified on-box) plus a metadata-stamped
`-dspark.mq2r` sidecar, certified `dspark_bench`, prompt md5
`70dd00052d9ff000`, 64 tokens greedy:

```
DSpark  tok/s=14.42  tau=2.286  accept=0.538 (35/65)
AR      tok/s= 8.39
```

**The load-bearing number is `accept=0.538`**, against the historical gfx1151
measurement for this artifact class of **0 of 89 accepted, tau 1.016**
(`2026-07-24-dspark-mq2r-p3`). Acceptance is a property of the model and the
draft path, not of the harness, so this result stands on its own.

Therefore `registry/deepseek4-mq2r-gfx1151-v2.json`'s
`rejected_mq2lloyd_payload_diagnostic_only` and the recipe spec's rejected
restamp (7.92 vs 30.21 AR) are **wrong about the cause** on the target hardware:
the sidecar was fine, the missing `MFP4G32E8SOA` match arm in
`dspark_core::gemv_auto_batched_wmma` was the defect. Both records should be
updated. Whether a properly P3-calibrated sidecar beats a restamped one is now
an open question that can finally be asked on a fair basis.

### CORRECTION: the 1.72x is harness-local, not a production number

`dspark_bench` is a research loop, not the production decode path. On the SAME
GPU with the SAME model file and digest, today's product bench via the daemon
measured **24.78 tok/s** at ctx 2048
(`hipx:/home/kaden/ds4-gfx1151-evidence/2026-08-03-ds4-0731-scoregrid-headpair/product-bench.json`,
`us_per_token=40356`, `kv_mode=q8`, `daemon_sha256=b82085af…`), versus
`dspark_bench`'s AR at **8.39 tok/s**. A ~3x harness gap.

Ruled out as causes: KV mode (forcing `HIPFIRE_KV_MODE=q8` changed nothing —
8.39 both ways; at 77 tokens of context KV traffic is negligible) and JIT
(`HIPFIRE_DEEPSEEK4_WARMUP=48` changed nothing). The remaining difference is the
binary and the path: the daemon carries graph capture, retained replay and the
optimised decode loop.

Two consequences:
1. **Do not quote 1.72x.** DSpark has NOT been measured on the production daemon
   path on gfx1151. Against a 3x-faster AR baseline the ratio will compress, as
   it did on MI300X (1.09x against a fast MQ2R trunk vs 1.53x against a slow
   MQ2-Lloyd one). The next measurement must be daemon-side.
2. **`dspark_bench` AR is not a valid perf baseline on gfx1151** and should not
   be used for one. It remains fine for acceptance/tau, which is what it was
   used for here.

Also observed: `.hipfire_kernels/` in that checkout holds a **gfx1100** cache
(261 kernels), so gfx1151 JITs cold, and the startup banner prints the
**gfx942** lever block (`deepseek4 gfx942 A2 levers: … F2 indexer_topk_bounded=OFF
(gfx942-v1 default ON …)`) even when the loader has selected `gfx1151 route v2`.
That banner is misleading on RDNA and cost real debugging time here.

### The rig-fidelity prediction held quantitatively

| | MI300X (gfx942) | gfx1151 |
|---|---|---|
| controller `ratio = dt/t_ar` | 0.356 | **0.119** |
| `t_ar` | 36.0 ms | 121.3 ms |
| `dt` | 12.82 ms | 14.46 ms |
| DSpark vs AR | 1.09x | **1.72x** |
| accept | 0.582 | 0.538 |

Marginal draft cost is 3x cheaper on the target, exactly as the flat WMMA
B-scaling curve predicted — so MI300X UNDERSTATED the win, in the predicted
direction. Acceptance differs (0.582 vs 0.538), consistent with the WMMA-vs-
scalar numerics divergence: acceptance measured on MI300X is rig-local.

### Immediate next lever

`ratio = 0.119` means the block controller's objective
`tau(N)/(t_ar + N*dt)` is very flat in N on gfx1151 — deeper blocks are nearly
free. The sidecar ships `block=5`. Since the Q8 draft path is flat in B out to
at least 13 on this part, the optimal block is bounded by ACCEPTANCE, not cost,
and block=5 is likely leaving throughput on the table. Tune it on gfx1151 —
never on MI300X.

### hipx staging notes

- `/home/kaden/hipfire-ds4-twostage` is NOT a git repo; deploy by rsync and
  verify with `git hash-object` / `sha256sum`. Its `dspark_core.rs` diverges from
  this branch (gfx942-only edits are absent), so patch the E8 arm by ANCHOR, not
  by line number or wholesale copy.
- `hipfire-arch-deepseek4` there has no `deltanet` feature; build
  `-p hipfire-arch-deepseek4 --example dspark_bench` with no `--features`.
- Artifacts staged at `/home/kaden/.cache/hipfire-surgery/`.

## DSpark on gfx1151 loses to AR — and DFlash is the reference for why

Measured on the PRODUCTION daemon path (gfx1151, 0731 MQ2R trunk
sha256 `cbf2bbcf…8cce`, `hipfire run`, 64 tokens, temp 0), after fixing
`hipfire run` (`3d74c9c47`):

```
--spec off     27.7 tok/s  drafter=ar      tau=1.00
--spec dspark  13.7 tok/s  drafter=dspark  tau=1.17  accept=39%  (29 windows)
```

DSpark is a **2x LOSS**. The AR figure corroborates the independent
product-bench on the same box/model (`hip=24.78`, `auto=27.98` at ctx2048), so
the baseline is sound. Note this INVERTS the `dspark_bench` picture (1.72x
"win"): that harness's AR is 8.39 tok/s, ~3x slower than production, so it
flatters speculation. Do not size speculation with `dspark_bench`.

### The arithmetic

The daemon's own fitted cost model prints `dt=14.61ms t_ar=121.1ms
(ratio=0.121)`. AR is 27.7 tok/s = **36.1 ms/token**. Break-even needs
`tau / (t_ar + N*dt) > 1/36.1`:

| N | window ms | break-even tau |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | 150.3 | **4.16** |
| 5 | 194.2 | **5.38** |

Measured tau is **1.17**. DSpark is not marginally behind — it needs tau > 4 to
break even, which no realistic draft delivers. **The lever is `t_ar`, not tau
and not draft cost.** Even free drafting (`dt=0`) at tau=2 gives
2/121.1ms = 16.5 tok/s, still under AR's 27.7.

### What DFlash does differently (the reference)

DFlash works — 4x on 27B code. A wrong hypothesis first, for the record: I
assumed DS4 verify was on the prefill path while DFlash used a decode path.
**False.** DFlash's verify is ALSO prefill-batch shaped
(`crates/hipfire-arch-qwen35/src/speculative.rs:2156,2413,2446,4087`). The
difference is narrower:

| | verify forward | graph-captured |
|---|---|---|
| DFlash | `forward_prefill_batch_single_chunk_captured_opts` | **YES** |
| DS4 AR decode | `decode_step_with_graph` (forward.rs:3217) | **YES** |
| **DS4 DSpark verify** | `forward_prefill_batch_chunked` (spec_impl.rs:253) | **NO** |

`spec_impl.rs` contains ZERO graph-capture calls — every "captured" in that file
refers to hidden states, not hipGraphs. DS4 already owns the machinery
(`begin_graph_capture`/`end_graph_capture`, forward.rs:3217-3224) and uses it for
its own AR decode; DSpark verify simply never got it.

DFlash documents the payoff of exactly this change
(`speculative.rs:2298-2301`): default-on for eligible models, "+14 % tok/s
25.6->29.2, wall-per-cycle 89->80 ms via coalescing verify kernels into one graph
replay and saving ~1.3 ms of per-cycle launch overhead". Opt out with
`HIPFIRE_VERIFY_GRAPH=0`.

Its eligibility rules are also the porting spec (`speculative.rs:2285-2296`): the
captured forward bakes in N via kernel grid dims, kernel selection, and
weight/buffer pointers; per-cycle inputs must be device buffers whose CONTENTS
change. Narrow eligibility: single-chunk only, no tree-verify (per-cycle
attention bias), pbs must be Some. And a warning worth heeding —
`HIPFIRE_VERIFY_GRAPH_TREE` is DIAGNOSTIC ONLY, known to collapse tau on code
(7.08 -> 4.51) when the captured region bakes in first-cycle state. That is the
failure mode to test for.

### MEASURED: verify_block is 90.7% of the window — the draft side is 9.3%

`HIPFIRE_DSPARK_PROFILE=1` (already in-tree, `dspark_core.rs:10-107`) on the
production daemon, gfx1151, 0731 MQ2R, 48 tokens / 22 windows:

```
bootstrap (initial-ctx seed capture):    115.35 ms    3.3%   mean=  5.24 ms/window
draft_block:                             123.99 ms    3.5%   mean=  5.64 ms/window
run_heads:                                87.24 ms    2.5%   mean=  3.97 ms/window
verify_block:                           3178.22 ms   90.7%   mean=144.46 ms/window
rest (accept+commit+etc):                  0.25 ms    0.0%   mean=  0.01 ms/window
total window time: 3505.04 ms                               mean=159.32 ms/window
```

This matches the fitted model (`t_ar=120.5ms`, `dt=14.67ms`) and settles the
plan:

**MQ4-quantizing the sidecar is NOT the lever — retracted.** It targets
`draft_block`, which is **3.5%** of window time. Even making the ENTIRE draft
side free (all 9.3%) moves 13.3 -> ~14.7 tok/s, still half of AR's 27.7. The
earlier reasoning that "dt=14.6ms ~ 3.7GB of traffic so the draft is
weight-bandwidth-bound" was arithmetically fine but irrelevant: `dt` is the
MARGINAL cost of one more drafted position, not the draft's share of the window.
Do not spend a quantization run on this.

**One `verify_block` costs 144 ms against a 36 ms AR decode step — 4x.** That is
the entire problem. It is a `forward_prefill_batch_chunked` call
(`spec_impl.rs:253`) over only ~2-3 rows, uncaptured, versus a graph-captured
`decode_step_with_graph` for AR.

### Inside the 144 ms verify: dense E8 WMMA is 57% at 53.5 GiB/s

`profile_prefill_deepseek4 --prefill 4 --pp-batch 8` on gfx1151 (the same
`forward_prefill_batch_chunked` verify uses). Total 147 ms — matches the live
`verify_block` mean of 144.46 ms, so the profiler reproduces the real call:

```
rnk kernel                                            calls  total_us   GiB/s     %
1   gemm_mfp4g32_e8_soa_wmma_gfx1151                    510   83897.7    53.5  57.0
2   deepseek4_gemv_mq2g256_lloyd_moe_gate_up_..._k4      43   25178.0   181.4  17.1
3   gemm_mfp4g32_e8_soa_grouped_wmma_gfx1151             43   15029.6    90.5  10.2
4   deepseek4_gemv_..._down_residual_scaled_..._k4       43   13727.1   166.9   9.3
    TOTAL                                                    147060.7
```

The dense E8 GEMM runs at **53.5 GiB/s while the MoE GEMVs in the SAME capture
hit 167-181 GiB/s** — a 3.4x intra-capture spread, so it is kernel shape, not
bandwidth. It is the B1 variant at batch 4: `e8_prefill_batch_tiles`
(`forward.rs:1266`) only selects b2 above batch 16 and b4 above batch 32, so
every speculative verify (B<=6) structurally gets tiles=1 and wastes 15/16 of
each 16-wide WMMA tile.

### A promising lever that MADE IT WORSE — do not retry

`crates/rdna-compute/examples/bench_e8_soa_correctness.rs` "Perf bench 2d"
already A/Bs exactly this, M=4096 K=4096 DRAM-resident:

```
  B     WMMA us  batched us   speedup   WMMA GB/s  batch GB/s
  1      177.43       48.16     3.68x        50.6       186.4
  2      177.99       52.12     3.42x        50.4       172.3
  4      178.03       79.14     2.25x        50.4       113.4
  6      178.96      127.64     1.40x        50.2        70.3
  8      179.08      156.23     1.15x        50.1        57.5
 16      180.70      299.81     0.60x        49.7        29.9
```

WMMA is flat at ~50 GB/s for every B (confirming the 53.5 GiB/s above), and the
batched GEMV looks 1.4-3.7x faster across the whole verify range. That path is
already implemented and wired — `e8_batched_gemv_applies` (`forward.rs:1292`)
with `E8_BATCHED_GEMV_BATCHES = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,16]` — but
`e8_batched_gemv_max_batch()` defaults to **0** (`forward.rs:783`,
`unwrap_or(0)`), so the arm never fires.

Enabling it end-to-end is a REGRESSION:

| `HIPFIRE_DEEPSEEK4_E8_BATCHED_GEMV` | AR tok/s | DSpark tok/s | verify_block |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (default) | 27.9 | 13.2 | 144.58 ms |
| 8 | 27.9 | **9.8** | **201.73 ms** |

Verify got **39% slower**. The default of 0 is correct and deliberate. The
microbench mispredicted because it measures ONE shape (M=4096 K=4096) while real
verify spans M=1024..32768, K=1024..8192 at batch 2-3 — a shape MIX. Treat
single-shape kernel microbenches as hypothesis generators only; this is the third
kernel-level lead this session that died end-to-end (see also the pipelined MFMA
GEMM and the Q8 wave64 port, both bit-exact and both neutral-or-worse).

So the 53.5 GiB/s dense-E8 path is real and is the dominant cost, but it is NOT
reachable through the existing lever. A fix means either lowering the b2/b4 tile
thresholds (`forward.rs:1266`) so verify-sized batches get tiled WMMA, or a
verify-shaped kernel — both requiring per-shape measurement across the real mix,
not a single-shape bench.

### Ordered plan (revised after measurement)

1. **Attribute the 144 ms verify call.** Run `profile_prefill_deepseek4` (or the
   in-tree per-kernel profiler) on gfx1151 against a small batch to see where a
   prefill-shaped forward spends its time versus a decode step. Launch overhead
   alone is unlikely to explain 144 vs 36 ms — at ~500 uncaptured launches and
   10-20 us host dispatch that is only 5-10 ms — so the prefill path is probably
   doing genuinely more work per call (batched compressor GEMMs, grouped MoE,
   F32->F16 staging) that the decode path avoids at B=1.
2. **Port DFlash's captured single-chunk verify** (`speculative.rs:2413,2446`,
   eligibility spec at `:2285-2296`). Reclaims the launch-overhead component;
   DFlash measured +14% from it. Necessary, not sufficient.
3. **Then, and only then, revisit block depth.** The Q8 B-curve is flat on
   gfx1151 out to B=13, so deep blocks are nearly free once the intercept is sane.

NOT on the list any more: MQ4 sidecar (3.5%), draft head quantization (the head
is already qt=35 MFP4G32E8SOA ~4-bit), VMM (orthogonal).

## The DSpark sidecar is quantized WRONG for its trunk (root cause of accept=41%)

A drafter should be far cheaper than its target. This one is not:

```
trunk :  82.19 GB / 43 layers = 1.911 GB per layer
draft :   6.00 GB /  3 stages = 1.999 GB per stage
=> a draft stage weighs 1.05x a trunk layer
```

The sidecar is built by `scripts/quantize-dspark.sh` with
`--format deepseek4-q8-mtp --include-prefix mtp.`, and that format falls back to
**Q8F16** (`crates/hipfire-quantize/src/main.rs:5082`, tier selection
`:7037-7043`). The trunk it drafts for is MQ2R: dense qt=35 MFP4G32E8SOA (~4-bit,
loader-enforced at `crates/hipfire-arch-deepseek4/src/arch.rs:708-710`) and
routed experts qt=19 MQ2-Lloyd (~2-bit).

So the draft is quantized 2-4x HEAVIER than the target it predicts.

### Why this caps acceptance, not just cost

Two separate arguments, and the second is the important one:

1. **Cost** — weaker. `draft_block` is only 5.87 ms of the 86.59 ms window
   (3.5%), so halving draft bytes buys ~3 ms. This is why an earlier "MQ4 the
   sidecar" proposal was retracted (see above). That retraction was correct
   about cost.
2. **Distribution — this is the real defect.** The draft's job is to predict what
   the TRUNK emits, not what the original checkpoint would emit. At Q8F16 the
   draft is MORE faithful to the checkpoint than the trunk is. Wherever the
   trunk's 2-4 bit quantization moves the argmax, the draft confidently predicts
   the un-quantized token and is rejected. The draft is systematically right
   about the wrong model. Matching the draft's quantization to the trunk's makes
   the two share the same quantization error so they agree where it counts.

This is exactly why DFlash's MQ4 drafts work well against MQ4 targets — not
merely because MQ4 is cheap, but because it is MATCHED.

It also explains the 41% acceptance ceiling better than the earlier
"restamped metadata" theory did. The restamp was NOT the problem (disproved: the
missing E8 arm was, `c420159e2`), but the RECIPE MISMATCH always was.

### Why the wrong recipe got applied

The Q8F16 choice is deliberate and correct for the case it was written for. The
sibling emitter `qwen3-dspark-q8` (`main.rs:6654-6669`) documents it:

    // Quant recipe (small trained drafter — preserve precision):
    //   2D matmul weights (attn q/k/v/o, mlp gate/up/down) -> Q8F16
    //   Everything else ... -> F16

"small trained drafter" is true of Qwen3's 5-layer DSpark drafter. DS4's
"drafter" is not small — it is three full DeepSeek blocks lifted out of the model
itself via `--include-prefix mtp.`, at 2 GB/stage. The same reasoning appears
again for `deepseek4-mtp-precise` (`main.rs:7051-7058`), which goes the WRONG
WAY for our purposes — it upgrades mtp dense to F16 to "eliminate Q8 quant
noise", doubling the addon, on the theory that "MTP is small enough that the
precision matters disproportionately". For a 6 GB DS4 sidecar drafting a 2-bit
trunk, precision-preservation is the bug, not the feature.

Note the two sidecar paths are structurally different and should not be
conflated: `qwen3-dspark-q8` consumes a SEPARATELY TRAINED drafter checkpoint
(it validates `architectures` is `Qwen3DSparkModel`/`DSparkDraftModel`/
`DSparkSpeculator`, `main.rs:6688-6705`), whereas DS4 extracts its own `mtp.*`
stages from the trunk checkpoint.

### Scoped fix: a trunk-matched DS4 sidecar format

Add a sidecar format that applies the MQ2R P3 recipe under
`--include-prefix mtp.`: dense/2D `mtp.*` -> qt=35 MFP4G32E8SOA, routed
`mtp.*` experts -> qt=19 MQ2-Lloyd, norms/HC -> F16. All machinery exists:

- qt=35 emission: `main.rs:6198,6327,6419,6590`; tier name parsing at `:5910`
  (`"mfp4e8soa" | "mfp4-e8-soa" | "mfp4e8-soa"`), display at `:5934`.
- MQ2-Lloyd experts are already the default expert tier for the deepseek4
  family; `deepseek4-mq4lloyd`/`mq3lloyd` (`:7049-7050`) show how to vary ONLY
  the expert tier while holding the rest, which is the same shape of change.
- `--include-prefix` already scopes a build to `mtp.*` (`:8273-8275`).
- The loader contract to satisfy is `validate_mq2r_dspark_sidecar`
  (`arch.rs:777-806`): metadata `mq2r_sidecar` with
  `target_recipe == "deepseek4-mq2r-e8-p3-v1"`, `draft_head ==
  "trunk_mfp4_e8_soa_b4"`, and NO `draft_head.weight` tensor. Emit that block at
  build time instead of stamping it afterwards
  (`scripts/reap/hfq_metadata_stamp.rs`).

Expected: sidecar ~6.0 GB -> ~2-3 GB, `draft_block` ~5.87 -> ~3 ms (minor), and
— the point — acceptance above the current 41%. This is strictly cheaper than
retraining a drafter and should be tried FIRST; retrain only if matched-recipe
acceptance still falls short.

**Unproven.** The acceptance argument is mechanistic, not measured. The
experiment is: build the matched sidecar, run `hipfire run --spec dspark` on
gfx1151 in both A/B orderings, and compare accept% and tok/s against the current
41% / 25.8 tok/s.
