# DS4 harmonic restart — gfx1100 + gfx1151

Date: 2026-08-07
Branch: `ds4-beta-staging` (now fast-forwarded to `ds4-gfx1201-opt` @ `eb55cda9b`)
Scope: the `hipx` pair **gfx1100 (RX 7900 XTX, 24 GiB, ~960 GB/s) + gfx1151
(Strix Halo 8060S, 96 GiB, ~256 GB/s)** only. gfx1010 / gfx1030 on the same
host are explicitly out of scope.

Supersedes the forward-work portions of
[`2026-08-06-deepseek4-harmonic-gfx1100-gfx1151.md`](2026-08-06-deepseek4-harmonic-gfx1100-gfx1151.md).
That document and the H0–H8 investigations remain the historical record.

## 1. Decision

Restart, importing from `ds4-gfx1201-opt` its **method and its decode kernel
levers** — and explicitly **not** its topology.

1. **Adopt the gfx1201 admission discipline verbatim** (§4). This is the
   highest-value import and it costs nothing.
2. **Reallocate the effort budget from transport to the gfx1100 serial tier**
   (§3). This is where the headroom is, and the failed campaign never spent
   there.
3. **Keep the asymmetric role split.** It is correct for this hardware. Do not
   port TP3/TP4, peer-HC, or attention-TP (§5).

The prior campaign is not being restarted. Its accepted mechanisms (ring
dataplane, residency plan, worker supervision) carry forward; its composition
program does not.

## 2. What actually happened

Measured product line, canonical 2,048/512 fixture:

| Route | tok/s | Note |
|---|---:|---|
| Single-gfx1151 retained-PM4 | 28.8678 | waterline; model fits in 96 GiB |
| Hetero + attention overlap | 30.0439 | G5 accepted |
| Hetero + grouped O-LoRA | **32.0029** | G5 accepted; still the high-water mark |
| DS4HARM2 fault-contained | 27.7100 | safety regression *below* single device |
| DS4HARM3 hotset 1400 | 31.5721 | recovers HARM2; does not beat 32.0029 |
| TG128 per-layer checkpointed AQL | 12.5142 | −58.74% vs 30.3318 control |

179 commits and ~27,400 net lines produced **+10.9% over a single gfx1151**,
and the fault-contained path is still 1.3% *below* the unsafe waterline it
replaced. T1 (50 tok/s) never came into range.

### 2.1 The arithmetic that condemned the chosen lever

The branch's own H1 bill (`docs/investigations/2026-08-06-ds4-harmonic-h1-critical-path.md:19-40`)
prices a token as:

```text
gfx1100 useful interval union                 17.014 ms
gfx1151 useful expert interval union           9.846 ms
measured cross-device useful overlap          -1.648 ms
                                              ---------
global useful interval union                  25.212 ms
canonical product wall                        31.247 ms
host/launch/queue/protocol residual            6.036 ms
```

Transport and composition work can only attack the **6.036 ms residual**.
Zeroing it *entirely* yields 25.212 ms → **39.66 tok/s**. The campaign's own
T1 gate is 50 tok/s.

**The lever the campaign spent 179 commits on could not reach its own minimum
target even at perfection, and H1 said so on 2026-08-06 at line 38.** Every
subsequent transport result is consistent with that: the mechanisms got
cheaper (ring 74.593 → 4.626 µs/chain; host-gated AQL 6.181 µs/gate) while
product throughput stayed pinned near 32.

## 3. Where the headroom actually is

At expert-branch balance the **gfx1100 serial tier is 77.7% of the useful
union**. Marginal return, computed from the residency model:

| Remove 1 ms from | Union improves by | Relative return |
|---|---:|---:|
| gfx1100 serial tier | 1.000 ms | **3.18×** |
| routed-expert work | 0.314 ms | 1.00× |

That tier is 15.3657 ms/token and its largest line item is a kernel H1 labels
*"exact-compiled generic fallback; not gfx1100-tuned"*: 511 calls, 7.586 ms,
2.858 GB, **376.7 GB/s on a 960 GB/s card** — 39% of peak. The one
exact-gfx1100 E8 kernel in the tree (grouped O-LoRA) reaches **544.2 GB/s** on
the same card and the same format.

### 3.1 Answering "what changes when you add a 2.2× CU / 3.8× BW tier"

Less than intuition suggests, and this is the load-bearing result. Sweeping
`r`, the unmeasured gfx1100/gfx1151 MQ2-Lloyd expert speed ratio, through the
whole plausible range:

| r | balanced hot fraction | useful union | useful ceiling |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1.00 | 46.35% | 21.422 ms | 46.68 tok/s |
| 2.184 (Qwen, borrowed) | 63.58% | 19.783 ms | 50.55 tok/s |
| 3.75 (pure BW ratio) | 73.18% | 18.870 ms | 52.99 tok/s |
| 5.00 | 77.25% | 18.483 ms | 54.10 tok/s |

A 5× swing in `r` moves the ceiling by 7.4 tok/s, because `T_serial` dominates
the union. **Consequences:**

- The residency plan is robust to `r`. Measuring it precisely is a tuning
  step, not a gate. Do not build a campaign around it.
- gfx1151's expert kernels are already at 213.7 GB/s ≈ 83% of a ~256 GB/s
  part. Agreed — that tier is well-tuned and is **not** a target.
- Adding gfx1100 as an *expert co-owner* is worth little. Its value is as the
  **dense/serial owner**, and that is where it is currently squandered.

### 3.2 Sizing the gfx1100 kernel campaign

H1's own H3 note proposed 600 GB/s. **That target is too weak** — it is 62.5%
of peak, and this codebase already does better than that on harder memory.

#### The efficiency proof point

| Achieved | Peak | % | Kernel |
|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 213.7 | 256 | **83.5%** | gfx1151 MQ2-Lloyd expert gate/up + down (production) |
| 544.2 | 960 | 56.7% | gfx1100 grouped O-LoRA E8 (accepted G5) |
| 403.1 | 960 | 42.0% | gfx1100 dense E8, weighted (the problem) |
| 376.7 | 960 | 39.2% | gfx1100 generic tier (H1 baseline symbol) |

Our own gfx1151 expert kernel sustains **83.5% of peak on unified LPDDR5X** —
an APU memory system that is *harder* to saturate than discrete GDDR6. The
same efficiency on gfx1100 is **802 GB/s**. That, not 600, is the target.

#### Why the dense kernel sits at 39%

**Corrected 2026-08-07 against generated ISA.** An earlier revision of this
section claimed codeword loads were "4 B per lane, a plain `dword`" and that
widening to `dwordx4` was the primary lever. That was read off source index
arithmetic, not compiled output, and it is **wrong**. Disassembly of both
kernels at `--offload-arch=gfx1100`:

| Kernel | `global_load_b128` | `global_load_b32` | `global_load_u8` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| generic `gemv_mfp4g32_e8_soa` | 6 | 3 | 3 |
| candidate `..._mlp.gfx1100` | 10 | 5 | 5 |

`b128` is a 16 B/lane load. The compiler **already** vectorizes the incumbent.
Load width was never the deficit.

The real limiter is still memory-level parallelism, but it is composed of:

- `__launch_bounds__(32)` with no min-waves hint. The grouped and gfx1151
  twins both set `(32, 7)`; the generic omits it.
- **One wave per workgroup, one row per workgroup** — the dominant term. Only
  one memory stream per workgroup, so requests in flight scale with workgroup
  count rather than with waves.
- **Shallow unroll** — 2 groups/iteration and 2 accumulators, giving 6 wide
  loads in flight per iteration where 10 are reachable.
- Zero LDS, register decode. ALU is ~10% utilized; it is not the constraint.
- The grouped variant reached 544.2 GB/s from **CU fill alone** (one
  8,192-wave grid replacing eight 1,024-wave grids) with an identical decode
  body — direct evidence that concurrency, not per-request width, is missing.

Little's Law: 800 GB/s at ~400 ns needs ~313 KB in flight, ~3.3 KB per CU
across 96 CUs. At `b128` that is ~7 concurrent wide loads per CU — reachable
by raising waves per workgroup and unroll depth, which is what the candidate
does.

#### The lift

| Weighted dense-E8 BW | % peak | serial tier | shared branch |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 403.1 (today) | 42.0% | 14.62 ms | 1.65 ms |
| 600 | 62.5% | 12.14 ms | 1.18 ms |
| 700 | 72.9% | 11.41 ms | 1.04 ms |
| **802** | **83.5%** | **10.86 ms** | **0.93 ms** |

Work items in evidence order: **rows per workgroup** (256 threads = 8 waves,
one row each) and **unroll depth** first; min-waves hint second; load width is
already handled by the compiler and needs no work.

**Baseline caveat resolved.** An earlier revision warned that `ds4_dense_e8`
might dispatch `gemv_mfp4g32_e8_soa_buffer_gfx1100`, making H1's 376.7 GB/s a
stale pre-buffer number. **It does not.** `ds4_dense_e8`,
`crates/rdna-compute/src/rdna3/gfx1100.rs`, and
`gemv_mfp4g32_e8_soa_buffer.gfx1100.hip` do not exist on `ds4-beta-staging` —
they are `ds4-harmonic-experimental` assets that the scouting pass read from
the wrong worktree. On staging the live gfx1100 dense-E8 dispatch is the
**generic fallback** at `crates/rdna-compute/src/gemv.rs`, with no gfx1100
branch at all. H1's profiled symbol is the deployed symbol, so the 7.586 ms
line item stands. R1 still re-bills per shape, but the sizing is not at risk.

The harmonic branch's unlanded gfx1100 E8 assets (`buffer`, `prefetch4_buffer`,
`scale_broadcast`) remain available as prior art if R4-BW needs them.

### 3.3 MEASURED per-shape bill (R1, 2026-08-08)

`rocprofv3` over the last 20 decode positions on `hipx`, branch `54948214e`.
Aggregate confirms the plan: **511 calls, 7.637 ms/token, 2.858 GB, 374.1 GB/s**
against a predicted 7.586 / 376.7 — 0.7% apart. Live symbol is the generic
`gemv_mfp4g32_e8_soa` via `gemv_mfp4g32_e8_soa_prerotated`
(`forward.rs:1128-1130`). Baseline stands.

Grid is reported in **threads**; workgroup is 32 and one row maps to one
workgroup, so `M = grid / 32`. Decomposed on that basis (self-consistent to
0.1% on time and 0.2% on bytes):

| M | calls/tok | ms/tok | MB/tok | GB/s | % peak | projections |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 129,280 | 1 | 0.412 | 283.4 | 687 | 71.6% | `lm_head` |
| 32,768 | 43 | 1.610 | 789.1 | 490 | 51.1% | `wq_b` |
| 8,192 | 21 | 0.230 | 96.3 | 419 | 43.6% | indexer `wq_b` |
| 4,096 | 86 | 2.042 | 963.8 | 472 | 49.2% | `wo_b` + shared `w2` |
| 2,048 | 86 | 0.999 | 386.1 | 386 | 40.2% | shared `w1` + `w3` |
| 1,024 | 85 | 0.890 | 190.8 | **214** | 22.3% | `wq_a` + main comp r4 pair |
| 512 | 83 | 0.774 | 93.2 | **120** | 12.5% | `wkv` + main comp r128 pair |
| 256 | 85 | 0.558 | 47.7 | **85** | 8.9% | `ffn.gate` + idx comp pair |
| 64 | 21 | 0.110 | 2.9 | **27** | 2.8% | indexer `weights_proj` |
| **total** | **511** | **7.627** | **2853.2** | **374** | 39.0% | |

**This overturns §3.2's targeting.** The plan named `wq_b` + `wo_b` +
`lm_head` (64.5% of bytes) as the problem. They are the *healthy* half:

| Tier | time | bytes | achieved |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| small-M (M ≤ 2048) | 3.333 ms — **43.7% of time** | 720.7 MB — 25.3% of bytes | **216 GB/s** |
| large-M (M > 2048) | 4.294 ms — 56.3% | 2132.5 MB — 74.7% | 497 GB/s |

`lm_head` is already at 71.6% of peak. The starvation is entirely in small-M,
and the cause is trivial once `M = grid/32` is seen: at one row per workgroup,
M=256 launches 256 waves across 96 CUs — **2.7 waves per CU**. M=64 launches
0.7. There is nothing to hide latency with.

#### Consequence for R4-BW

**The candidate kernel as built targets the wrong half.** Packing 8 rows into a
256-thread workgroup leaves the *wave count unchanged* — M=256 becomes 32
workgroups × 8 waves = the same 256 waves. It improves per-workgroup latency
hiding, which helps the large-M tier that is already at 497 GB/s. It cannot
create parallelism where M itself is the limit.

Small-M needs one of:
- **split-K** — partition K across workgroups, partial dot products, reduce.
  For M=256, K=4096 an 8-way split gives 2,048 workgroups instead of 256.
- **R4-PACK** — already implemented, and worth far more than the ~1.45 ms this
  document originally sized. Every packed group sits inside the starved tier
  (`w1`+`w3` at 386, main comp r4 at 214, r128 at 120, idx comp at 85 GB/s),
  and packing a pair doubles the grid exactly where occupancy is the binding
  constraint.

#### Revised tier projection

| Case | small-M | large-M | tier total | saving | weighted |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| today | 216 | 497 | 7.627 ms | — | 374 GB/s |
| conservative | 497 | 600 | 5.004 ms | 2.623 ms | 570 GB/s |
| mid | 687 | 700 | 4.095 ms | 3.532 ms | 697 GB/s |
| target | 802 | 802 | 3.558 ms | 4.069 ms | 802 GB/s |

## 4. The imported method (non-negotiable)

Verbatim from the gfx1201 campaign:

- **2% product admission threshold.** A candidate projecting under 2% gets no
  product bench. A candidate measuring under 2% gets one sample, then stop —
  no second or third process.
- **Micro projections are admission filters, never ceilings.** The attention-TP
  micro projected 36.6 tok/s and product delivered 41.2059.
- **Three fresh-process samples** for any decode promotion; report median and
  range spread. Accepted gfx1201 spreads ran 0.073%–0.65%.
- **Mandatory byte-identical golden.** Full decoded output SHA-256 must match.
  A coherent-but-different output is a rejection, not a judgement call — the
  gfx1201 prefill HC WMMA candidate measured 479.3291 tok/s and was rejected
  on SHA alone.
- **Screen, then `Revert`.** A rejected experiment is reverted in the same
  ladder, not left in the tree. This is the single biggest process difference
  between the two branches.
- **Durable evidence tree per checkpoint**, with binary and prompt digests.

## 5. What does not port, and why

| gfx1201 lever | Status here | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Attention TP over RCCL (+16.50%) | **Unavailable** | Mixed gfx1100/gfx1151 RCCL communicator fails `invalid device function` |
| Peer barrier + `hc_mix_4stream_peer4` (+4.32%) | **Prohibited** | Device-side reciprocal peer wait — the exact pattern quarantined after two incidents that stranded both GPUs |
| Shared-expert dense TP4 (+4.35%) | **Not applicable** | Requires equal shards on identical devices |
| Owned-expert skip (+14.42%) | **Not applicable** | Requires symmetric EP ranks |
| Prefill native DSA WMMA / wide-E8 | **ISA-locked** | `__builtin_amdgcn_wmma_f32_16x16x16_f16_w32_gfx12`; RDNA4 fragment shapes ≠ RDNA3 |

**Do not attempt symmetric TP/EP on this pair.** Replicated work runs at the
speed of the slowest rank; gfx1151 is 3.75× slower on bandwidth. Symmetric
sharding would be *worse* than the current role split. The asymmetric split is
correct — it was never the problem.

## 6. What does port — all four decode levers are structural

Source audit found **no WMMA intrinsics and no gfx12 guards** in any of the
four accepted gfx1201 *decode* levers. All are launch fusion, LDS pattern, job
packing, or workgroup width. The merge in §7 already brought the kernels into
the tree, so most of this is **re-gating, not porting**.

| Lever | gfx1201 Δ | Mechanism | Port cost | Numerics |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `hc-fusions` | +7.3041% | 4 launches → 1 control path | **trivial re-gate** — harmonic gates it gfx1151-only at `forward.rs:888-896` | order-preserving |
| grouped O-LoRA half | — | 8→1 launch | **already banked** on gfx1100 at 544.2 GB/s — do not re-port | raw-bit |
| `nox` low-LDS RMSNorm/FWHT | +2.1826% | LDS (K+256)·4 → 32 B, wave-first reduce | **trivial re-gate** — `norm.rs:4193` excludes gfx1100 | **changes FP32 reduce order — needs golden** |
| `mixed-e8-projections` | +2.7045% | ≤7-job mixed-M packing | **moderate** — `shared_jobs.gfx1100.hip` exists but is same-M, 2–3 jobs, and unwired | low |
| `T1024 HC control` | +2.8615% | workgroup 256 → 1024 | **trivial** after `hc-fusions` | **LDS tree 8→32 — needs golden** |

## 7. Merge completed

`ds4-beta-staging` was a strict ancestor of `ds4-gfx1201-opt`, so the merge was
a pure fast-forward: `b4e944370..eb55cda9b`, 229 commits, pushed to `origin`.

This is behaviour-neutral off gfx1201: every lever is gated on exact gfx1201 +
MQ2R + TP3/TP4, with generic binding defaults false for Qwen, MiniMax,
gfx1100, gfx1151, other formats, and other rank counts.

It also changes the restart's shape — `hc_finalize_control.hip`,
`hc_compute_control.hip` (vec4_finalize + T1024), the `nox` RMSNorm variant,
and `gemv_mfp4g32_e8_soa_shared_jobs.gfx1100.hip` are now all in the base tree.

## 8. Target and feasibility envelope

**AR target: 50 tok/s** on the canonical 2,048/512 fixture, gfx1100 + gfx1151.
Locked 2026-08-07. `20.000 ms/token` total wall.

The single variable that decides the campaign is the **achieved dense-E8
bandwidth on gfx1100** (§3.2). Sweeping it against the residual:

| Dense-E8 BW | % peak | useful union | resid 5.15 | resid 4.0 | resid 3.0 | resid 1.0 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 403 (today) | 42.0% | 19.04 ms | 41.3 | 43.4 | 45.4 | 49.9 |
| 500 | 52.1% | 17.38 ms | 44.4 | 46.8 | 49.1 | **54.4** |
| 600 | 62.5% | 16.23 ms | 46.8 | 49.4 | **52.0** | **58.0** |
| 700 | 72.9% | 15.41 ms | 48.6 | **51.5** | **54.3** | **60.9** |
| **802** | **83.5%** | **14.79 ms** | **50.2** | **53.2** | **56.2** | **63.3** |
| 850 | 88.5% | 14.54 ms | **50.8** | **53.9** | **57.0** | **64.3** |

`resid 5.15` is Levers A + B with launch fusion but **no Lever C**.
`resid 1.0` is Lever C landing fully.

Two conclusions:

1. **At 802 GB/s the target is met without Lever C** (50.2 tok/s). The kernel
   campaign carries the campaign. This is the primary path.
2. **T2 = 60 tok/s is back on the table** at 802 GB/s with Lever C (63.3). An
   earlier revision of this document called T2 unsupported; that was an
   artefact of the weak 600 GB/s target, and is withdrawn.

### 8.1 Why the residual only falls to ~5.15 ms from kernels alone

The residual is dominated by host launch cost, so it tracks dispatch count.
H1 measured 3,165 dispatches/token against a 6.036 ms residual. Launch fusion
attacks both terms: `hc-fusions` removes 3 × 86 = 258 dispatches, mixed-E8
packing ~205. That is 3,165 → 2,702, a 14.6% cut, and 6.036 → **5.153 ms**.
Note the bandwidth work does *not* reduce launch count — wider loads and
better occupancy leave the dispatch count unchanged — so these two halves of
Lever A are independent and both are needed.

### 8.2 Lever C — coarse whole-token retained owner body

**Status: margin, not requirement.** It is the difference between hitting 50
and hitting 60, and it is the insurance policy if the E8 tier lands at 700
rather than 802.

Already measured on this exact hardware
(`docs/investigations/2026-08-07-ds4-gfx1100-owner-throughput-gate.md:13-20`):

| gfx1100 owner body | ms/token | tok/s |
|---|---:|---:|
| direct HIP | 21.318 | 46.9086 |
| retained as **one** PM4 packet | 16.440 | 60.8265 |

**4.878 ms/token of host/launch cost removed, bit-identical logits, 12/12
samples.** Discounted for the dispatches Lever A already removes, retention is
worth ~4.16 ms — taking the residual to ~1.0 ms.

**This is the lever that killed the last campaign, and the distinction is the
whole plan.** What was rejected on TG128 (−58.74%) was *43 separately prepared,
per-layer checkpointed queues* costing ~1.20 ms/layer of submit/wakeup/wait.
What is proposed is *one persistent owner tape per token* with owner-local
finite gates, measured at **6.181 µs/gate = 0.266 ms/token** across 43 gates.
That is a 194× difference in synchronization tax, and it is the next cut the
TG128 doc itself prescribes at `:118-132`.

**Hard pre-gate, no exceptions:** before any model run, screen the
continuation protocol with a small multi-checkpoint oracle and demonstrate a
projected ≥2% end-to-end win. If the oracle does not clear, Lever C is dead
and we ship on the kernel campaign — not pursued on faith. This is exactly
the gate the previous campaign lacked. Because C is now margin rather than
requirement, killing it is cheap.

## 9. Restart ladder

Measurement on `hipx` is a **serial resource** — fresh-process benchmarking
with ±10–15% DPM/thermal drift means no two candidates may be timed
concurrently. Implementation parallelizes; screening does not.

**Wave 1 — implement concurrently, each behind its own admission flag,
default off.** No benchmarking, no shared-file coordination needed.

| Slice | Work | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **R4-BW** | **The campaign.** Rewrite the gfx1100 dense E8 GEMV for memory-level parallelism: `dwordx4` loads, multiple rows per workgroup, `(32,7)` min-waves, deeper unroll. Target 802 GB/s. | `gemv_mfp4g32_e8_soa_buffer.gfx1100.hip` |
| R2 | `hc-fusions` re-gate onto exact-gfx1100 MQ2R | `forward.rs:888-896` |
| R3 | `nox` re-gate + T1024, as two independent gates | `norm.rs:4193`, `attention.rs` |
| R4-PACK | `shared_jobs` wiring for `w1`/`w3` + compressor pairs (~1.45 ms) | `gemv.rs`, `forward.rs` call sites |
| C-oracle | Multi-checkpoint continuation oracle for Lever C (§8.2 pre-gate) | new bench |

R4-BW is the critical path and should be staffed accordingly: §8 shows the
whole target turns on it, and every other slice is worth 2–7% against its
~9 tok/s.

**Wave 2 — screen serially on hipx, in this order.** Each under §4: 3 fresh
processes, median + range spread, mandatory byte-identical golden, 2% gate,
revert on reject.

- **R0** Re-establish the waterline. Every figure in §2 predates the merge.
- **R1** Re-bill the dense E8 tier **per projection shape**, not flat, and
  confirm whether `buffer_gfx1100` or the generic symbol is live. This scopes
  R4-BW and may show the 7.586 ms line item is already partly stale.
- **R4-BW** first, because it is the campaign. Screen at the shape level
  before the product run: a per-shape bandwidth micro is cheap and its
  projection gates the product sample.
- **R2** → **R3** (two separate screens, both need fresh goldens) →
  **R4-PACK**.
- **C** only if its oracle cleared ≥2%. Skip without regret if R4-BW landed
  at or above 802 GB/s.
- **R5** Rate-matched residency last. Measure `r` once; §3.1 shows it is worth
  ~4 tok/s of ceiling, not a campaign. Do not max-fill VRAM.

### 9.1 Stop conditions

- R4-BW below **700 GB/s** after the shape work: Lever C moves from margin to
  required, and its oracle becomes a blocking gate rather than optional.
- R4-BW below **600 GB/s**: stop and re-bill. The memory-parallelism diagnosis
  in §3.2 is then wrong and the campaign needs a new root cause before more
  effort is spent.

## 10. Do not retry

- **Per-layer checkpointed / host-gated AQL composition.** −58.74% on TG128.
  The gfx1201 branch independently closed the same family after one screen
  (graph-resident barrier, −17.442%). Two branches, two mechanisms, same
  verdict: fine-grained in-queue synchronization loses. Lever C (§8.2) is the
  *coarse* one-tape-per-token shape, not this; keep the distinction sharp.
- **E8 four-group prefetch.** Micro won 1.034 ms; product lost 0.534% because
  the gfx1151 wait branch lengthened. Conditional revisit *after* R5 balance,
  never as a cold retry.
- **ROCr IPC signal as a GPU dependency.** Cycle-0 KFD page-not-present.
- **Ragged wkv+compressor collapse.** HIP 700, stuck in
  `drm_sched_entity_flush`.
- **Any device-side reciprocal peer wait.** Quarantined; strands both GPUs.

## 11. Follow-up

`docs/investigations/2026-08-07-gfx1201-ds4-dense-tp.md:11-17` states the
gfx1201 work "is isolated on `ds4-gfx1201-opt`" and that the heterogeneous line
"remains on `ds4-beta-staging`". Both clauses are stale after §7. The file is a
dated investigation record, so it is left as-written; this section is the
correction.

## 12. R0 waterline (certified 2026-08-08)

Post-merge re-measurement on `hipx`, branch `ds4-beta-staging` @ `54948214e`.

| Sample | decode tok/s |

- **Median 32.154 tok/s**, range spread **0.104%**, 31.100 ms/token.
- vs the historical 32.003 line: **+0.47%**, within DPM/thermal noise. The
  merge did not regress the hetero route.
- All three outputs byte-identical, 2,491 bytes, MD5 `ee05ab4f07393fb7d624d966a7dde4af`.

# 13. HALTED — rig incident 2026-08-08, implementation reverted

**Status: this plan is PAUSED. All Wave 1 / Wave 2 code has been reverted.
Only this document survives.**

## What happened

Screening the first candidate lever (`HIPFIRE_DS4_GFX1100_E8_PACK`, the
`shared_jobs` compressor/FFN packing) on `hipx` produced an SDMA fault that
took gfx1100 off the PCIe bus:

```text
sdma1 timeout seq 1362/1364
sdma reset failed
GPU reset -19
device lost from bus
SMU: bus error ... response:0xFFFFFFFF
```

The run never emitted `"status":"generated"` and stalled with the dense GPU at
0%. The next lever screened (`HC_FUSE`) then hung in D state
(`drm_sched_entity_flush`, `amdgpu_vm_wait_idle`) because it could not
enumerate an absent device — **collateral, not a defect in that lever.**

Recovery without a reboot was attempted and **failed**. Config space on the
GPU, and on both ports of the card's on-board Navi switch (`0000:65:00.0`,
`0000:64:00.0`), all read `ffff`; only the root port `0000:00:03.1` stayed
alive. `echo 1 > .../remove` unbound amdgpu but then blocked permanently
against stuck TTM kworkers (6 → 16). A secondary bus reset driven from the
root port did not re-train the link. The machine required a physical reboot.

## Verdicts

| Lever | Verdict |
|---|---|
| baseline (no gates) | 32.1926 tok/s, golden SHA matched, coherent — **valid** |
| `E8_PACK` | **HARD DEFECT** — SDMA timeout, card off bus |
| `HC_FUSE` | **UNJUDGED** — collateral of the wedge, never ran |
| `E8_MLP`, `NOX`, `T1024`, `E8_MIX` | never screened |

## Why it was halted

The operator is remote; a wedged card requires someone physically present to
reset the machine. That risk is not worth a decode-throughput experiment. The
implementation is reverted to the `ds4-gfx1201-opt` merge point
(`eb55cda9b`) so no gate, kernel, or dispatch path from this campaign remains
in the tree.

## Preventable causes — all spec-level, all mine

1. **No fault-containment protocol in the task spec.** `/usr/local/sbin/gpukill`
   exists on this fleet for exactly this failure and was never mentioned. The
   screener used bare `timeout 600`; the child outlived SIGTERM, orphaned, and
   kept holding the card.
2. **Fixture discipline inverted.** This repo's own rule is that TG128 is the
   screening fixture and 2,048/512 is reserved for a passing promotion
   candidate. Four never-executed kernels were sent straight at the promotion
   fixture on an 82 GB model.
3. **Static validation mistaken for verification.** VGPR counts, zero spills,
   `global_load_b128`, and bit-exact accumulation order were all checked. None
   of them says anything about *addressing*, and an out-of-range row offset is
   precisely what times out SDMA. `test_mfp4e8_shared_jobs_gfx1100.rs` already
   existed as a micro for the failing kernel and was never run.
4. **Rig cleared as healthy while it was dying.** The post-hang check was
   `dmesg | tail -40 | grep`, too narrow to catch the SDMA errors, so the next
   lever was allowed to start on a card already off the bus.

## Preconditions for any resumption

Do not restart this campaign without all four:

- **Micro before model.** Every new kernel runs its standalone unit test on
  small buffers first. No exceptions.
- **TG128 before 2,048/512.**
- **`gpukill` teardown after every run**, never bare `timeout`.
- **Health gate between screens**: full-dmesg scan for
  `lost from bus|reset failed|ring timeout|GPU reset`, plus a trivial HIP
  context open. Never a truncated tail.
- **Physical access to the machine, or an out-of-band power control**, before
  the first candidate is screened.

## What remains valid

Sections 1–12 stand as analysis. The measured R0 waterline (32.1926 tok/s,
golden SHA `3611840208334c77b3cfcf85984786920deabd550ba83311645f413d3ba6608b`)
and the R1 per-shape bill in §3.3 are real measurements and are the correct
starting point if this is ever resumed. §3.3's central finding — that the
small-M tier burns 43.7% of dense-E8 time for 25.3% of the bytes at 216 GB/s,
because one row per workgroup gives 2.7 waves/CU at M=256 — is independent of
the reverted implementation.

The reverted code is recoverable from git history at `dfe7bda37` and
`6720ac059` should it ever be wanted; it is removed from the tree, not lost.
