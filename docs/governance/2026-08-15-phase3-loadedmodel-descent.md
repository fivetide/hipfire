# Phase 3 — the `LoadedModel` descent

**Status: two of four steps landed and byte-verified. Two remain, both blocked on missing harnesses.** This is the only remaining path to two
Phase-2 deliverables that are otherwise structurally unreachable. Everything below was
measured against `arch/saddle` at `1f1bf9d1c`, not estimated.

## The two items this closes

| deliverable | state at `1f1bf9d1c` | why it is stuck |
|---|---|---|
| `carriers.rs` is registration only | 2,292 lines (was 2,656) | `Carrier::load` returns `LoadedModel`, a loader type |
| loader + daemon `ModelState::` refs 0 | daemon 3, loader 97 | Rust cannot construct an enum variant without naming it |

Both reduce to one fact: **`hipfire-loader` depends on every arch crate, so arch crates
cannot depend on the loader.** A `Carrier` impl living in an arch crate would have to name
`LoadedModel`, and that closes the cycle.

## The design that breaks it

Move `LoadedModel` and `Carrier` down into `hipfire-runtime`, which both sides already
depend on. Then arch crates implement `Carrier` in their own crate, and `carriers.rs`
becomes what the objective asks for: a list.

That requires `LoadedModel` to stop naming architecture types. It names six today:

```
pub state:             Option<ModelState>            // 11-variant closed enum
pub pp_scratch_set:    Option<Qwen35ScratchSet>
pub dots_ocr_config:   Option<dots_ocr::DotsOcrConfig>
pub dots_ocr_weights:  Option<dots_ocr::DotsOcrWeights>
pub vision_config:     Option<qwen35_vl::VisionConfig>
pub vision_weights:    Option<qwen35_vl::VisionWeights>
```

plus `qwen2_state` and `deepseek4_pbs` reachable from the same struct.

`state` becomes `Option<Box<dyn ArchModel>>`; `ArchModel` gains an `Any` supertrait with
`as_any_mut()`. The five side-car fields move **into their owning bundles**, where they
belonged all along — the VL pair exists only because `Qwen35Carrier` side-loads a vision
tower it cannot store anywhere else (`carriers.rs:497-543`).

## Measured blast radius

| surface | count | notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `hipfire-generate` `ModelState::` sites | **143** | 45 `if let Some(X(b))`, 33 match arms, 9 constructions |
| `hipfire-loader` `ModelState::` | 97 | adapter (22) + free dispatch (11) + construction |
| daemon `ModelState::` | 3 | redline snapshot, two VL-path resets |
| arch-typed `LoadedModel` fields to rehome | 6 | listed above |

`hipfire-generate`'s matches become downcasts. That is compatible with the objective's
protection of that crate — it keeps naming arch crates, which is the point of a composition
root; only the *form* changes from enum match to `as_any_mut().downcast_mut::<T>()`.

Cost is a downcast per request, not per token, provided the concrete reference is taken once
at the top of each `generate_*` body. Anything that downcasts inside the decode loop is a
defect, not a design.

## What this does NOT buy

**Roughly two registration sites.** The tax is already at **10 required out-of-crate code
sites**, which meets the objective. Do not undertake this for the number. Undertake it
because a closed 11-variant enum in another crate is a thing every new architecture must
edit, and deleting it is a genuine structural win.

## Why it was not done in the Phase-2 session

Not scope reduction — sequencing, on one specific ground: **the paths it touches are the
ones that session could not runtime-verify.**

The verification harness in use covered lfm2moe, gemma4, muse-glimmer and qwen35, all
text-only, on hiptrx. The refactor touches the VL side-load, dots-ocr, PP scratch, EP state
and unload. hiptrx carries **zero** VL/OCR fixtures; the six that exist are on the
single-GPU local box. A change to the VL side-load proven only to compile is exactly the
kind that ships silent breakage, and this repo's own rule is that decoded output — not a
green build — is the evidence.

## Verification this phase owes before it can land

1. **Text regression** — the existing four-architecture sweep on hiptrx, decoded output read.
2. **VL** — `dots-ocr` and an `ovisocr2` variant with a real image, locally, output read.
   No VL fixture exists on hiptrx; either copy one or accept the local single-GPU run.
3. **PP / EP** — the multi-GPU paths that own `pp_scratch_set` and `EpState`, on hiptrx's
   four R9700s. These have no coverage in the current harness and need one built.
4. **Unload** — a load/unload/reload loop per architecture. `free_gpu` moved once already in
   Phase 1; the Glimmer arm leaks ~1.3 GB over five cycles if only one side is freed
   (PR #566), so this needs a VRAM-delta check, not just an absence of crashes.

## Sequencing note

Do the side-car rehoming **first**, as its own landable change. Moving `vision_config` /
`vision_weights` into the Qwen35 bundle and the dots-ocr pair into its own is independently
valuable, independently verifiable, and shrinks the descent to the `state` field alone. A
single change that moves `LoadedModel`, deletes `ModelState`, rehomes six fields and rewrites
143 call sites is not reviewable.

## Progress log

### Landed — arch-typed `LoadedModel` fields 6 -> 2

**Step 1, vision side-cars.** `dots_ocr_config` / `dots_ocr_weights` collapsed into one
bundle; `vision_config` / `vision_weights` moved into `Qwen35Bundle`, staying `Option`
because `Qwen35Carrier` side-loads the tower only after probing
`model.visual.patch_embed.proj.weight` and a text-only Qwen3.5 has none. Created a new
`qwen35 -> qwen35-vl` edge — acyclic, and the crate-map drift check caught it unprompted.

**Step 2, dots-ocr normalised.** Ten architectures lived in `ModelState`; dots-ocr alone rode
as a separate field, so every consumer had to know two places a model could live. Now
`ModelState::DotsOcr`. Its `pp>1` unload arm is empty by design — dots-ocr has no pipeline
parallelism — but the match stays exhaustive so omission is a compile error.

**Verification method, both steps.** A decoded baseline was captured BEFORE each change from
a real dots-ocr run over `benchmarks/images/dots_ocr_smoke_001.jpg` — 19,520 patches through
the RDNA4 WMMA vision path, producing HTML tables from a scientific paper — and diffed after.
**Byte-identical, 8,286 bytes, both times.** Text-only generation confirmed separately. A
compile proves nothing on these paths.

### Remaining — and why each is blocked

```
pub state:           Option<ModelState>            // the enum itself
pub pp_scratch_set:  Option<Qwen35ScratchSet>      // pipeline-parallel scratch
```

**`state`** needs the 143-site `hipfire-generate` conversion to downcasts. Unchanged from the
original scoping.

**`pp_scratch_set` is NOT a single field and must not be moved as one.** `skeleton_pp`
(`hipfire-loader/src/lib.rs:1241-1262`) sets four multi-GPU fields as a unit, and its own
comment says why: *"a dropped `pp_scratch_set` is a silent VRAM leak; `pp_gpus` /
`pp_dn_la_to_device` are `.expect()`ed in unload."* Moving one breaks a coupling that exists
deliberately to prevent that leak.

Moving all four also drags `Gpus` — device placement — which the layering deliberately keeps
out of `saddle-core`.

Pipeline parallelism is reachable only through the daemon's `load` params (`pp`), not a
`serve` flag, is restricted to Qwen3.5 dense and MoE, and is mutually exclusive with `tp>1`.
There is no PP fixture or harness, and the failure mode is a *silent* VRAM leak — which a
functional smoke test would not catch. **This step needs a load/unload VRAM-delta harness
built first.** That is the prerequisite, not the refactor.


## Blocker update — the VRAM oracle exists and Qwen3.5's baseline is clean

`scripts/vram_leak_harness.py` was the named prerequisite for the `pp_scratch_set` step. It
now exists, and it discriminates.

Measured on hiptrx (gfx1201, single GPU), five/four load-unload cycles:

| model | per-cycle delta | slope | verdict |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `qwen3.6-27b.mq4` | +202, +202, +202, +202 | **+0.0 MiB/cycle** | clean |
| `lfm2.5-8b-a1b.mq4` | +212, +218, +224, +230, +236 | **+6.0 MiB/cycle** | SUSPECT |

Two things follow.

**Qwen3.5 single-GPU teardown is provably clean**, which is the baseline the
`pp_scratch_set` work needs — that field belongs to Qwen3.5's pipeline-parallel path, and
any drift introduced by moving it would now be visible against a flat control.

**lfm2moe retains ~6 MiB on every unload.** Small, but five samples with zero scatter is not
allocator jitter. Recorded, not chased: it wants its own investigation. It is also why the
harness scores R² rather than magnitude alone — a 32 MiB/cycle threshold called this clean,
and it is not.

### What the step still needs

A `pp>1` run. Pipeline parallelism is reachable only through the daemon's `load` params, is
Qwen3.5 dense/MoE only, and is mutually exclusive with `tp>1`; the harness drives exactly
that protocol, so extending it is `params: {"pp": 2}` plus a multi-device VRAM sample.
That is a small change to a tool that now exists, rather than the missing capability it was.


## The oracle found a live pp>1 leak, and it is fixed

Building the harness to de-risk moving `pp_scratch_set` found the bug that field's own
comment warns about — before any code moved.

`qwen3.6-27b` on hiptrx, four load/unload cycles each:

| | per-cycle delta | slope | |
|---|---|---:|---|
| pp=1 (control) | +202 ×4 | +0.0 | flat |
| pp=2 **before** | +244, +269, +285, +299 | **+18.1** (R² 0.980) | leaking |
| pp=2 **after** | +202 ×4 | **+0.0** (R² 1.000) | fixed |

**Cause.** The pp>1 load allocates *two* scratches: a per-device `Qwen35ScratchSet` stored as
`LoadedModel.pp_scratch_set`, and the bundle's own single-device `Qwen35Scratch`. Teardown
freed only the set, orphaning `bundle.scratch` on every pp>1 unload. The single-GPU path
frees all four GPU-owning bundle fields, which is why pp=1 was flat and only the multi-GPU
arm drifted.

**Pre-existing.** The pp>1 teardown diff against `8510ca5f2` is empty; this work did not
introduce it. Post-fix steady state is 202 MiB — identical to pp=1, which is the
corroboration that the freed allocation was exactly the missing scratch.

**Consequence for the descent.** `pp_scratch_set` now has a clean, measured baseline on the
configuration it belongs to, which is what the step was waiting for. The blocker is
discharged; what remains is the `state` field and its 143-site `hipfire-generate`
conversion.


## Step 4 attempted: the accessor indirection is only partly viable

`LoadedModel` is now down to ONE architecture-typed field, `state`. The plan was to convert
`hipfire-generate`'s call sites to typed accessors first, so the eventual storage swap to
`Box<dyn ArchModel>` would change only the accessor bodies rather than ~143 call sites at the
same time as the type.

The accessor set was completed (twelve bundles, all reachable the same way). The conversion
then landed **15 sites of 154**, and the reasons the rest resisted are the real finding.

**Rust borrow semantics, not volume, are the constraint.** A direct
`if let Some(ModelState::Qwen35(b)) = m.state.as_mut()` borrows only the `state` FIELD, so
the same expression can touch `m.prefill_checkpoints` alongside it. An accessor
`m.qwen35_mut()` borrows **all of `m`**, so those sites stop compiling. `ar.rs:2581` is the
clean example: it binds the bundle and a prefill checkpoint in one `if let` tuple.

Three categories resisted, all correctly:

| category | why |
|---|---|
| borrow-disjointness | accessor borrows whole `m`; direct match borrows one field |
| multi-arm dispatch | `map_or`/`and_then` closures matching 2+ architectures — an `if let` chain changes control flow |
| construction (~10) | building `Some(ModelState::X(..))` must name the variant; correct as-is |

**Consequence for the descent.** 124 code sites remain, and a meaningful fraction of them are
borrow-shape-sensitive rather than mechanical. `Box<dyn ArchModel>` + `Any` downcast has the
same borrow property as the accessor — `downcast_mut` on a boxed field borrows the field, so
disjoint-field cases may actually survive better than the accessor did. That is worth
checking before committing: it flips the difficulty estimate.

The 15 that did convert are strictly better and are kept. No behaviour changed; workspace
builds and 1,997 lib tests pass.


## Step 6: generate converted to downcasts — 124 -> 43 code sites

The borrow question raised by the accessor attempt is settled, and the conversion it was
blocking has largely landed.

`ArchModel` gained an `Any` supertrait and `as_any_mut()` across all 16 impls. Every
converted site uses:

    m.state.as_mut()
        .and_then(|s| s.as_arch_model_mut().as_any_mut().downcast_mut::<T>())

which borrows the `state` FIELD. That is the whole difference: the accessor borrowed all of
`m` and converted 15 of 154; this converted 64 across the same files, including
`ar.rs:2581`, which binds the bundle alongside `m.prefill_checkpoints` and defeated the
accessor outright.

### The 43 that remain, and what each means for the swap

| kind | count | disposition |
|---|---:|---|
| construction — `Some(ModelState::X(..))` | ~10 | must name the variant; the type change replaces these directly |
| multi-arm dispatch across 2+ arches in ONE expression | 6 | `map_or` with a default arm, `and_then` returning `Option`. An if-let chain changes control flow. **These are the real design work left.** |
| remainder | ~27 | mostly `redline.rs` fixtures; same pattern, not yet swept |

The six multi-arm dispatches are the honest residue. They are not volume, they are a
question: what replaces a match that returns different things per architecture when there is
no enum to match on? Options are a trait method covering the shared concern (both `ar.rs`
cases read a KV `compact_offset`, which `ArchModel` could expose), or an explicit downcast
chain that accepts the control-flow change. The `ar.rs` pair in particular looks like it
wants `ArchModel::kv_compact_offset()`.

### Verification at this step

- dots-ocr VL output **byte-identical**, 8,286 bytes, against the pre-descent baseline
- three architectures generating coherent text on hiptrx at `029f2facd`
- pp=2 VRAM **+0.0 MiB/cycle** over three cycles
- workspace builds, 1,997 lib tests pass


## Step 7 and the final tally: generate 124 -> 36, and the 36 are characterised

Two more gaps closed. `ArchModel` gained `as_any()` for shared reads — the mutable-only
hatch forced read-only sites to take `as_mut()` purely to downcast, and was simply
impossible where a caller holds `&LoadedModel`. And variant PREDICATES (`matches!`, "is this
architecture X" with no binding) convert via the `arch_key()` the trait already had, no
downcast needed.

### What did NOT convert is the useful part

**`arch_key` is not injective.** `Deepseek4Bundle` and `Deepseek4HeterogeneousBundle` both
return `"deepseek4"`, so an `arch_key` predicate would WIDEN
`matches!(.., Some(ModelState::Deepseek4(_)))` from the single-GPU variant to both. All six
deepseek4 predicates were correctly left alone.

That generalises: `arch_key` exists to match `reset_core`'s inventory, not to identify a
variant. Any future code reaching for it as an identity test must check that first.

### The 36 remaining, by kind

| kind | count | what the storage swap does with it |
|---|---:|---|
| construction — `m.state = Some(ModelState::X(..))` | 10 | becomes `Some(Box::new(bundle))`; mechanical, and the type change IS this edit |
| `Deepseek4` predicates (`matches!`) | 5 | need a variant-identity mechanism `arch_key` cannot give — a `TypeId` check via `as_any().is::<T>()` would work |
| multi-arm dispatch, 2+ arches in one expression | 6 | the genuine design question: 4 in `redline.rs` fan out Qwen35/Deepseek4/Lfm2Moe; the 2 in `ar.rs` both read a KV `compact_offset` |
| remaining single-variant extractions | ~15 | same proven downcast; unswept only |

**On the `ar.rs` pair specifically**: `kv_cache_mut()` looks like the answer and is not.
Five bundles return `Some` from it — cohere2moe, lfm2moe, llama, minimax, qwen35 — while the
dispatches handle only llama and qwen35 and default the rest. Substituting would silently
widen the guard to three more architectures. Whether that exclusion is deliberate or a latent
bug is a maintainer question, not something a refactor should decide.

### Verification at this step
dots-ocr VL output **byte-identical**, 8,286 bytes. Workspace builds, 1,997 lib tests. The
`--all-targets` gate caught the trait's own test impl missing `as_any`, which a plain
`cargo build` did not — keep it in the loop for trait changes.
