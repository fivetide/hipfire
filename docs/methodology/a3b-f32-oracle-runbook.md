# Runbook — a3b native F32 oracle + KLD reference on a rented MI300X

Produces a **hipfire-native** KLD reference for `qwen3.6-35b-a3b` at meaningful
scale. Native means the reference distribution comes from hipfire's own F32
forward, not llama.cpp — see `feedback_kldref_must_be_native_oracle` and the
0.29–0.36 nat cross-engine floor measured in F1.

**Precedent:** this is the F1/F2 path, re-run at a3b scale. Both were built and
validated on MI300X (gfx942, ROCm 7.0), 2026-06-03/04:

- `docs/plans/2026-06-02-hfqv2-implementation/experiments/self-sufficient-eval/F1-native-bf16-build.md`
- `.../F2-native-eval.md`

F1 added the `qt=2` / `qt=16` arms in `load_weight_tensor_raw`
(`qwen35.rs:1555`) and the `--format f32` passthrough (`main.rs:8408`). No new
code is required for this run.

**This exact oracle has already been run at a3b scale.**
`docs/moe-awq/SESSION_FINDINGS_2026-06-11.md:4` — *"All KLD vs an f32-native
oracle (`q36a3b-f32-oracle.hfq`); refs `q36a3b-{wt2,agentic}-f32.kldref.bin`.
Branch `feat/moe-awq-experts` on mi300."* The artifacts survive on the NAS:

```
/mnt/nas/kaden/hipfire/models/Qwen3.6-35b-a3b/
    qwen3.6-35b-a3b.f32.hfq      138,658,609,664 B   (Jun 11)
    kldref/wt2.kldref.bin         16,842,528 B  md5 456ddaef569977b372a8c32b5dacbd2f
    kldref/agentic.kldref.bin     16,842,528 B
```

`wt2.kldref.bin` is **byte-identical** to `~/.hipfire/models/q36a3b-wt2-f32.kldref.bin`,
so the ref behind every a3b KLD number in
`docs/investigations/2026-08-04-a3b-lowbit-quality.md` — including the 0.238060
`.mq2` baseline — is confirmed native, not merely inferred to be.

**No new kernels.** F32 routed experts are not indexable, so `run_moe_decode`
drops to the generic CPU-top-K fallback and issues per-expert `weight_gemv` →
`gemv_f32`. There is no F32 MoE kernel in the tree and none is needed; the June
findings state it directly (`:132`, *"eval via the CPU-top-K fallback (how the
f32 oracle runs)"*). This is why oracle throughput is tens of tok/s: 8 separate
launches per layer instead of one indexed kernel.

**So this run is a re-run at larger scale, not a bring-up.** The only thing
changing is `--n-ctx` / `--max-chunks`.

## Why MI300X and not the local fleet

| oracle | size | fits? |
|---|---|---|
| F32, 1× MI300X (192 GB HBM3) | ~140 GB | **yes** |
| F32, 4× R9700 EP (128 GB) | 32.2 GB experts + 11.2 GB replicated dense = **43.4 GB/rank** | no (32 GB cards) |
| BF16 on disk | ~70 GB file, but `qwen35.rs:1555` widens to F32 at load → still 140 GB VRAM | no |

`DType::BF16` has exactly one reference in the runtime (a byte-size arm).
Resident-bf16 compute is F1's documented gap #2 and is **not** needed here.

---

## Preconditions

- **GPU:** 1× MI300X (gfx942), ROCm 7.x. Single card — no TP/EP.
- **Disk:** ≥ 400 GB (70 GB checkpoint + 140 GB oracle + headroom).
- **RAM:** ≥ 200 GB to use `HIPFIRE_NO_SPILL=1`. Otherwise the spill path needs
  ~2× the output on disk (280 GB).
- **No `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION`.** gfx942 is natively supported.

---

## Step 0 — bring up and build

```bash
rocminfo | grep -m1 gfx                      # expect gfx942
git clone <hipfire> && cd hipfire
git checkout a3b-lowbit-work                 # or master; the oracle path is on both

cargo build --release -p hipfire-quantize
cargo build --release --example build_kld_ref_native -p hipfire-runtime \
    --features arch-qwen35,deltanet
cargo build --release --example eval_hipfire -p hipfire-runtime \
    --features arch-qwen35,deltanet
```

`build_kld_ref_native` declares `required-features = ["arch-qwen35", "deltanet"]`
— omitting them silently skips the example.

## Steps 1–2 — get the oracle onto the box

The oracle already exists (see above), so there are two routes. Pick on
bandwidth:

- **Upload the NAS copy** — 138.7 GB from home. Correct but slow on a typical
  residential uplink (~6 h at 50 Mbps). Skips Steps 1–2 entirely.
- **Re-encode on the box** — cloud↔HF bandwidth is usually far better than home
  upload, so downloading 70 GB from HF and re-encoding is often *faster* than
  pushing 138.7 GB up. Follow Steps 1–2 below.

Either way, verify against the known-good artifact:

```bash
stat -c %s <oracle>.hfq        # must be 138658609664
```

A re-encode should reproduce that byte count exactly — same source, same
`--format f32`, deterministic passthrough. A mismatch means a different
checkpoint revision or a different format flag; stop and reconcile.

## Step 1 — fetch the checkpoint

```bash
hf download Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B --local-dir /workspace/q36a3b-hf
```

Verify before encoding — the encoder keys off these:

```bash
python3 -c "import json;c=json.load(open('/workspace/q36a3b-hf/config.json'));\
t=c['text_config'];print(t['model_type'],t['num_hidden_layers'],t['num_experts'],\
t['hidden_size'],t['moe_intermediate_size'],c['text_config']['dtype'])"
# expect: qwen3_5_moe 40 256 2048 512 bfloat16
```

If the repo id differs, resolve it by those identifiers rather than by name —
the registry calls it `qwen3.6-35b-a3b` but the HF `model_type` is `qwen3_5_moe`.

## Step 2 — encode the F32 oracle (~140 GB, CPU only, no GPU needed)

```bash
HIPFIRE_NO_SPILL=1 \
./target/release/hipfire-quantize \
    --input  /workspace/q36a3b-hf \
    --output /workspace/q36a3b-f32-oracle.hfq \
    --format f32
```

- `--format f32` (aliases `f32-passthrough`, `oracle`) stores **every** tensor as
  `QuantType::F32` (qt=2), widening bf16→f32 losslessly. 3-D stacked MoE experts
  are split per-expert automatically (`[oracle split]` lines in the log) — the
  loader reads `...experts.{X}.{gate_up,down}_proj.weight` and would panic on the
  stacked form.
- `HIPFIRE_NO_SPILL=1` holds tensors in RAM and writes the output directly. If
  RAM is tight, drop it and set `HIPFIRE_SPILL_DIR=/workspace/spill` (needs 2×
  output on disk), or point it at `/dev/shm` if RAM is ample but disk is tight.

Expect ~140 GB out (35B × 4 B). F1's 9B oracle was 35.8 GB, same ratio.

## Step 3 — smoke ref (do this before the long run)

```bash
md5sum benchmarks/quality-baselines/slice/wikitext2-1024s-2048ctx.txt
cat    benchmarks/quality-baselines/slice/slice.md5      # must match

./target/release/examples/build_kld_ref_native \
    --model  /workspace/q36a3b-f32-oracle.hfq \
    --slice  benchmarks/quality-baselines/slice/wikitext2-1024s-2048ctx.txt \
    --output /workspace/q36a3b-wt2-f32-native-SMOKE.kldref.bin \
    --top-k 256 --n-ctx 512 --tokenize-mode hipfire --max-chunks 8
```

`--tokenize-mode hipfire` is the llama-free path: hipfire's own BPE from the
oracle `.hfq` metadata. The tool internally forces `HIPFIRE_NORMALIZE_PROMPT=0`,
`HIPFIRE_GRAPH=0`, `HIPFIRE_KV_MODE=f32`.

Time this run — it sets the budget for Step 5. F1 measured ~35 tok/s on the 9B
dense F32 oracle; a3b is MoE (3B active) so expect the same order, but measure
rather than assume.

## Step 4 — soundness checks (gate the long run on these)

Scored tokens per chunk = `n_ctx - 1 - n_ctx/2` → 255 at n_ctx=512, 1023 at 2048.

1. **Oracle PPL — known-good target.** `build_kld_ref_native` prints mean NLL /
   PPL over the scored window. The June run measured **wt2 5.350** / agentic
   5.902 (`SESSION_FINDINGS_2026-06-11.md:42`). Expect to land near 5.350 on the
   wt2 slice; a longer `--n-ctx` shifts it somewhat, but not by much. Anything
   at or above the `.mq2` candidate's 6.2181 means the forward is broken — stop.
2. **Known-good candidate.** Score a high-precision SKU against the smoke ref:

   ```bash
   ./target/release/examples/eval_hipfire \
       --model ~/.hipfire/models/qwen3.6-35b-a3b.mq3p \
       --ref /workspace/q36a3b-wt2-f32-native-SMOKE.kldref.bin --kv-mode f32
   ```

   The reference flag is `--ref` (not `--kldref`); `--kv-mode f32` routes to
   `KvCache::new_gpu` — the true-FP32 KV path F1 added.

   F2's 9B Q8-vs-native-oracle was **0.0086 nats**. A high-precision a3b SKU
   should land in that neighbourhood — small, not ~0.2. If it comes out near the
   `.mq2` value, the oracle is not actually higher-precision than the candidate.
3. **Continuity.** Score `.mq2` and confirm it lands in the ballpark of the
   existing **0.238060**. Different token stream and count means it will not
   match exactly — an order-of-magnitude difference is the red flag, not a few
   percent.

## Step 5 — the real reference

Match the 27B MASTER's scale (2048 × 97 = 99,231 scored tokens):

```bash
./target/release/examples/build_kld_ref_native \
    --model  /workspace/q36a3b-f32-oracle.hfq \
    --slice  benchmarks/quality-baselines/slice/wikitext2-1024s-2048ctx.txt \
    --output /workspace/q36a3b-wt2-f32-native.kldref.bin \
    --top-k 256 --n-ctx 2048 --tokenize-mode hipfire --max-chunks 97
```

That is **12×** the current a3b ref (8160 tokens) and moves to 2048-ctx, which
is more representative than 512. Scale `--max-chunks` to the measured rate from
Step 3; F2's note is that a full 1175-chunk canonical run is ~8.5 h at 35 tok/s.

**Regenerate the agentic slice too.** The June run produced both
(`kldref/agentic.kldref.bin`, oracle PPL 5.902), and agentic-domain KLD is much
closer to what an mqNr SKU is actually used for than wikitext2 is. Same command
against the agentic slice — while the box is up and the oracle is resident, the
marginal cost is only the second forward.

F32 KV at n_ctx=2048 is negligible here (~82 MB — 10 full-attention layers of
40, 2 KV heads × 256 head_dim).

## Step 6 — retrieve and record

The artifact is small (~200 MB at 99k tokens; the current 8160-token ref is
16.8 MB). Pull only the `.bin` — leave the 140 GB oracle on the box.

```bash
scp <box>:/workspace/q36a3b-wt2-f32-native.kldref.bin ~/.hipfire/kldref/
```

Record alongside it, or the ref is unusable for cross-session comparison:

- oracle `.hfq` md5 + size, and the hipfire commit it was built from
- slice md5 (must equal `slice.md5`)
- `n_ctx`, `n_chunk`, `top_k`, scored-token count
- oracle mean NLL / PPL from Step 4.1
- `--tokenize-mode hipfire` (llama-free), ROCm version, gfx942

Then supersede `q36a3b-wt2-f32.kldref.bin` (8160 tokens) as the a3b baseline and
**re-measure `.mq2`** to establish the new baseline number. Every prior a3b KLD
in the investigation doc is tied to the old ref and does not transfer.

---

## Failure modes

- **`tensor not found: ...experts.0.gate_up_proj.weight`** — the 3-D expert split
  didn't fire. Confirm `[oracle split]` lines appear in the Step 2 log.
- **`_ => panic!` in `load_weight_tensor_raw`** — a qt with no arm. The oracle
  should be qt=2 throughout; check with
  `hfq_dump /workspace/q36a3b-f32-oracle.hfq | head -40`.
- **OOM during encode** — drop `HIPFIRE_NO_SPILL=1` and set `HIPFIRE_SPILL_DIR`.
- **OOM on load** — 140 GB against 192 GB is comfortable, but confirm nothing
  else holds the card (`rocm-smi`).
- **Oracle PPL ≈ candidate PPL** — the forward is not running at the precision
  you think. Do not proceed; the reference would be worthless.

## Cost

~$2–4/hr. Encode is CPU-bound (~1 h), ref generation is the GPU cost measured in
Step 3. Budget one working session; the artifact is reusable indefinitely.
