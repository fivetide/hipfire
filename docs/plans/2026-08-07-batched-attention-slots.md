# Ragged Multi-Slot Batched Attention (SP1) — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Give hipfire's Q8_0 and asym3 attention kernels a *slot* dimension, so a single launch serves several independent sequences — each at its own position, each attending only to its own KV — as the kernel foundation for running 3–4 coding agents concurrently on a 32 GB R9700.

**Architecture:** The batched kernels already take a device `positions[]` array and launch one workgroup per (head, query-row-tile). The only thing binding them to one sequence is the scalar `k_cache`/`v_cache` base pointer. We add two device arrays — a per-slot `KvSlotDesc` table and a per-tile `tile_slot[]` map — and route every KV address through one device helper, `kv_offset_for(slot, pos)`. Contiguous per-slot slabs today; a block table later changes that one function, not the kernels.

**Tech Stack:** Rust (`rdna-compute` crate), HIP C++ kernels compiled at runtime via `ensure_kernel` with `#define` injection, `cargo run --release --example` harnesses.

**Spec:** `docs/specs/2026-08-07-batched-attention-slots.md`. Read it before starting; this plan implements it and does not restate its reasoning.

## Global Constraints

- **Implementation branch:** `feat/batched-attn-impl`, worktree `~/repos/hipfire-batchattn-impl`. **All code work happens here.** It was cut from `feat/batched-attention-slots` (worktree `~/repos/hipfire-batchattn`), which carries the spec and this plan and is kept pristine as the reference — do not commit code to it. Both descend from `origin/beta` @ `e2f7dd1a`.
- **Toolchain:** ROCm 7.2.2, `hipcc` at `/opt/rocm-7.2.2/bin/hipcc` (already on PATH). Target arch for local builds is `gfx1151`.
- **Dev hardware is gfx1151 (Strix Halo); target is gfx1201 (R9700).** No tuned constant may be baked into a Rust `const`. Every tuning value must be env-overridable.
- **KV modes in scope: Q8_0 and asym3 only.** Do not touch asym2, asym4, fwht{2,3,4}, or lloyd kernels.
- **Backward compatibility is mandatory.** When the descriptor pointer is null, every kernel must behave *bitwise identically* to its current single-sequence behaviour. All existing call sites pass null initially.
- **Q8_0 block layout:** 34 bytes per 32 values (`f16` scale at bytes 0–1, then 32 `int8` codes). Per-position stride is `n_kv_heads * (head_dim/32) * 34` bytes.
- **Existing routing constant:** `LDS_CTX_LIMIT = 15000` at `crates/hipfire-runtime/src/llama.rs:2637`. Do not change its value.
- **Tile constants:** `TILE_SIZE = 128`, `stride = 2 + head_dim` (partials are `m`, `l`, then `head_dim` accumulators), `max_tiles = ceil(max_ctx_len / TILE_SIZE)` — `crates/rdna-compute/src/attention.rs:3473`.
- **Licence header** on every new file, matching existing files:
  ```
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
  // Copyright (c) 2026 Nick Woolmer
  // hipfire — see LICENSE and NOTICE in the project root.
  ```
- **Always pass `--features deltanet`.** Every cargo command in this plan carries it. Both target models are DeltaNet hybrids, and more immediately: `cargo test -p rdna-compute` **cannot build without it** on `beta`. The example `rope_compact_offset_check` calls `rope_partial_interleaved_f32{,_batched}`, which are `#[cfg(feature = "deltanet")]` (`crates/rdna-compute/src/norm.rs:711` and `:966`), but the crate declares no `required-features` for it.
- **That example breakage is PRE-EXISTING on `origin/beta` and is NOT ours to fix.** Do not "repair" it, do not add `required-features`, do not edit `rope_compact_offset_check`. If you see four `E0599: no method named rope_partial_interleaved_f32...` errors, you dropped `--features deltanet`. Verified baseline **with** the flag: `118 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored`.
- **Build check after every Rust change:** `cargo build --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet`.
- **MEMORY GATE — MANDATORY, NON-NEGOTIABLE.** On 2026-08-07 the SP1 harnesses
  drove **nine global OOM kills** on the dev box between 18:41 and 19:14. The
  victims were the user's applications — steamwebhelper x4, teams-for-linux x3,
  slack, a Firefox tab — **not** our benchmark, which reported success. On Strix
  Halo the GPU's GTT is system RAM and the box has **no swap**, so an overshoot
  does not degrade; it goes straight to the *global* OOM killer, which picks
  victims by `oom_score` rather than by who caused it.
  - **Run every GPU harness or benchmark through `scripts/run-bounded.sh`.**
    It runs the command in a cgroup (`MemoryMax`, default 24 GiB,
    `HIPFIRE_MEM_CAP` to override) so an overshoot kills *our* process, not the
    user's desktop. Exit 137 means the gate fired: **shrink the configuration,
    do not raise the cap.** It also refuses to start when `MemAvailable` is
    already below a floor.
  - **Call `kv_slots::preflight_alloc(total_bytes, what)` before allocating**
    in any new harness, passing the TOTAL held live at once, not one buffer. It
    refuses configurations that exceed the 32 GiB R9700 target budget or would
    leave this box without headroom, and it fails closed if `/proc/meminfo` is
    unreadable. Skip the configuration on `Err`; do not proceed.
  - **Free per-iteration GPU tensors inside sweep loops.** Holding every slot's
    or every configuration's buffers live across a sweep is what turns a modest
    per-run footprint into an OOM.
  - **A live `free` will NOT show this problem.** Between runs the box looks
    healthy (~60 GiB available). Diagnose after the fact with
    `journalctl -k | grep -E 'page allocation failure|Out of memory|oom-kill'`.
    The symptom the user actually notices is desktop stutter and applications
    silently disappearing.
- **NEVER MUTATE THE USER'S GLOBAL CONFIG.** `~/.hipfire/config.json` is the
  user's live working configuration, not a test fixture. On 2026-08-07 a Task 9
  agent edited it to run its arms, then died mid-way through restoring it,
  leaving `max_seq` at 16384 instead of 131072 — which would have silently
  truncated the user's own long-context runs. Everything these tasks need is
  already exposed as an environment variable (`HIPFIRE_KV_MODE`,
  `HIPFIRE_LOCAL`, `HIPFIRE_MEM_CAP`, `HIPFIRE_ATTN_TILE_SIZE`,
  `HIPFIRE_VRAM_BUDGET_BYTES`, …). **Pass env vars per invocation. Do not write
  to any file under `~/.hipfire/`.** If something genuinely cannot be set by
  env, stop and report it rather than editing the file — a config edit that
  survives a crashed agent is worse than a missing measurement.
- **Commit after every task.** No task may be left half-committed.

**Task order rationale:** Task 1 (Task 0 in spec numbering) runs first because its result can cancel or re-aim the rest. Tasks 2–3 build the ABI. Tasks 4–7 port one kernel each — each independently reviewable and revertible. Task 8 benches. Task 9 gates asym3 quality.

### Task 1: Batching-ceiling probe (spec §12, "Task 0")

Validates or replaces the roofline estimates *before* kernel work. Measures whole-step decode latency versus context length at batch 1 and fits a line; the intercept is the context-independent term (weights), the slope is the KV/attention term.

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/rdna-compute/examples/probe_batching_ceiling.rs`
- Create: `docs/perf-checkpoints/2026-08-07-batching-ceiling-probe.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces: measured `a` (ms, context-independent) and `b` (ms per 1K context) per model; a corrected version of spec §8. No code consumed by later tasks.

**Why no per-op timing:** per-operation `device_synchronize` fabricates GPU speedups. The slope fit needs only whole-step wall time, which is why it is the chosen method.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the probe harness**

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify it compiles**

Run: `cargo build --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet --example probe_batching_ceiling`
Expected: compiles clean. The `Gpu` API used here is `upload_f32`, `upload_raw`, `zeros`, and `gpu.hip.device_synchronize()` — there is no `alloc_tensor` for zeroed buffers, no `upload_i32`, and no `Gpu::synchronize`. `crates/rdna-compute/examples/q8_batched_attn_microbench.rs` is the reference idiom.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the probe**

Run: `cargo run --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet --example probe_batching_ceiling`
Expected: four `ctx=... median_ms=...` lines with monotonically increasing times, then a fit line with positive `a` and positive `b`.

If `b` comes out near zero or negative, the measurement is broken — most likely the kernel is not actually reading the full context. Do not proceed; investigate first.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run for the 27B shape**

Run: `NH=24 NKV=4 HD=256 LAYERS=16 cargo run --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet --example probe_batching_ceiling`
Expected: a noticeably steeper `b` than the 35B shape — the 27B moves 32 KB/token against the 35B's 10 KB.

- [ ] **Step 5: Write the results note**

Create `docs/perf-checkpoints/2026-08-07-batching-ceiling-probe.md` containing: the raw `ctx`/`median_ms` tables for both shapes, the fitted `a` and `b`, the predicted speedups at N=2/4/8, and an explicit statement of whether spec §8's ~3.3× (27B) and ~1.8× (35B) survive. State plainly that this measures the attention term only — the weights term is inferred, not measured, because SP1 does not run a full model forward.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/rdna-compute/examples/probe_batching_ceiling.rs docs/perf-checkpoints/2026-08-07-batching-ceiling-probe.md
git commit -m "perf(attn): empirical batching-ceiling probe

Latency-vs-context slope fit at batch 1, separating the term that
amortises across slots from the KV term that does not. No per-op
device_synchronize — those fabricate GPU speedups."
```

### Task 2: `KvSlotDesc` device header and `kv_offset_for()`

The paged seam. Every KV address in every ported kernel goes through this one helper.

**Files:**
- Create: `kernels/src/kv_slot_desc.h`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces: `struct KvSlotDesc { unsigned long long k_base; unsigned long long v_base; int seq_len; int cap; }` and `__device__ unsigned long long kv_offset_for_k(const KvSlotDesc&, int pos, int per_pos_bytes)` and the matching `kv_offset_for_v`. Tasks 4–7 include this header. Task 3 mirrors the struct layout in Rust.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the header**

Create `kernels/src/kv_slot_desc.h`:

```c
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
// Copyright (c) 2026 Nick Woolmer
// hipfire — see LICENSE and NOTICE in the project root.
//
// Multi-slot KV descriptor — the single point of KV address translation for
// every batched attention kernel.
//
// A "slot" is one independent sequence in a batch. Today each slot owns a
// contiguous slab of `cap` tokens inside a per-layer arena, so translation is
// base + pos*stride. When this moves to paged block tables, ONLY
// kv_offset_for() changes — no kernel is touched. That is the entire reason
// this indirection exists; do not inline it away.
//
// Layout must stay byte-identical to the Rust mirror in
// crates/rdna-compute/src/kv_slots.rs. 24 bytes, 8-byte aligned.

#ifndef HIPFIRE_KV_SLOT_DESC_H
#define HIPFIRE_KV_SLOT_DESC_H

struct KvSlotDesc {
    unsigned long long k_base;  // byte offset of this slot's K slab in the arena
    unsigned long long v_base;  // byte offset of this slot's V slab in the arena
    int seq_len;                // logical KV length; kernel reads [0, seq_len)
    int cap;                    // physical slab capacity in tokens; seq_len <= cap
};

// Byte offset of position `pos` within slot `s`'s K slab.
// `per_pos_bytes` is the per-position stride in bytes, uniform across slots
// (n_kv_heads * (head_dim/32) * 34 for Q8_0).
__device__ __forceinline__ unsigned long long kv_offset_for_k(
    const KvSlotDesc& s, int pos, int per_pos_bytes)
{
    return s.k_base + (unsigned long long)pos * (unsigned long long)per_pos_bytes;
}

__device__ __forceinline__ unsigned long long kv_offset_for_v(
    const KvSlotDesc& s, int pos, int per_pos_bytes)
{
    return s.v_base + (unsigned long long)pos * (unsigned long long)per_pos_bytes;
}

// Single-slot fallback used when the descriptor pointer is null. Keeps the
// ported kernels on ONE code path: callers build this on the stack from the
// legacy scalar args, so there is no `if (descs) ... else ...` around every
// KV read. Behaviour is then bitwise identical to the pre-SP1 kernel.
__device__ __forceinline__ KvSlotDesc kv_slot_legacy(int seq_len, int max_seq)
{
    KvSlotDesc s;
    s.k_base = 0ULL;
    s.v_base = 0ULL;
    s.seq_len = seq_len;
    s.cap = max_seq;
    return s;
}

#endif  // HIPFIRE_KV_SLOT_DESC_H
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify the header compiles standalone**

Run:
```bash
cd ~/repos/hipfire-batchattn && echo '#include "kernels/src/kv_slot_desc.h"
__global__ void probe(const KvSlotDesc* d, unsigned long long* o){ *o = kv_offset_for_k(d[0], 5, 1088); }' > /tmp/kvdesc_probe.hip && hipcc -c /tmp/kvdesc_probe.hip -o /tmp/kvdesc_probe.o --offload-arch=gfx1151 -I. && echo COMPILE_OK
```
Expected: `COMPILE_OK`.

If `hipcc` is not on PATH, source the ROCm environment first — a missing `hipcc` is an environment problem, not a code problem.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify the struct is 24 bytes**

Run:
```bash
cd ~/repos/hipfire-batchattn && echo '#include <cstdio>
#include "kernels/src/kv_slot_desc.h"
int main(){ printf("%zu %zu\n", sizeof(KvSlotDesc), alignof(KvSlotDesc)); }' > /tmp/kvdesc_size.cpp && g++ -D__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__ /tmp/kvdesc_size.cpp -o /tmp/kvdesc_size -I. -I/opt/rocm-7.2.2/include && /tmp/kvdesc_size
```
Expected: `24 8`

If it prints anything else, the Rust mirror in Task 3 must match whatever it prints — but 24/8 is what the layout above should give, and a different answer means a field was changed.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add kernels/src/kv_slot_desc.h
git commit -m "feat(attn): KvSlotDesc device header and kv_offset_for helper

The single point of KV address translation for batched attention. Moving
to paged block tables later changes only this file."
```

### Task 3: Host-side slot table and tile-list builder

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/rdna-compute/src/kv_slots.rs`
- Modify: `crates/rdna-compute/src/lib.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the 24-byte layout from Task 2.
- Produces:
  - `pub struct KvSlotDesc { pub k_base: u64, pub v_base: u64, pub seq_len: i32, pub cap: i32 }` (`#[repr(C)]`)
  - `pub fn build_tiles(slot_query_counts: &[usize], br: usize) -> (Vec<i32>, Vec<i32>, Vec<i32>)` returning `(tile_slot, tile_row0, tile_qbase)`
  - `pub fn total_rows(slot_query_counts: &[usize]) -> usize`

`tile_qbase` is included from the start because the prefill kernel in Task 6 needs it: `tile_row0` is slot-relative (it restarts at 0 for each slot) but `q` and `out` are indexed by the global flat row.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `crates/rdna-compute/src/kv_slots.rs` with the struct, a stub `build_tiles` that returns empty vectors, and these tests:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cargo test --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet kv_slots`
Expected: FAIL — `tiles_never_span_a_slot` and the others fail on empty vectors returned by the stub.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

Replace the stub in `crates/rdna-compute/src/kv_slots.rs`:

    let mut global = 0usize;
    for (slot, &m) in slot_query_counts.iter().enumerate() {

        while row0 < m {
            tile_slot.push(slot as i32);

            tile_qbase.push((global + row0) as i32);

        }
        global += m;

    (tile_slot, tile_row0, tile_qbase)

```

Then add to `crates/rdna-compute/src/lib.rs`, alongside the other `pub mod` declarations:

```rust
pub mod kv_slots;
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `cargo test --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet kv_slots`
Expected: PASS, 7 tests.

```bash

### Task 4: Port `attention_q8_0_kv_batched` (LDS decode/verify path)

**Files:**
- Modify: `kernels/src/attention_q8_0_kv_batched.hip`
- Modify: `crates/rdna-compute/src/attention.rs:1584-1680` (`attention_q8_0_kv_batched_masked`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `KvSlotDesc` / `kv_offset_for_k` / `kv_offset_for_v` / `kv_slot_legacy` (Task 2); `KvSlotDesc` Rust mirror (Task 3).
- Produces: `Gpu::attention_q8_0_kv_batched_masked_slots(..., slot_descs: Option<&GpuTensor>, row_slot: Option<&GpuTensor>)`. The existing `attention_q8_0_kv_batched_masked` stays, delegating with `None, None`.

**Critical:** with `slot_descs == nullptr` the kernel must produce bitwise-identical output to today. That is what Step 5 checks.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the descriptor args to the kernel**

In `kernels/src/attention_q8_0_kv_batched.hip`, add `#include "kv_slot_desc.h"` after the `hip_runtime.h` include, then append two parameters to the kernel signature (append only — never reorder, the kernarg blob is positional):

```c
    int block_cols,                         // ignored when tree_bias == nullptr
    const KvSlotDesc* __restrict__ slot_descs,  // [n_slots] or nullptr = legacy
    const int* __restrict__ row_slot            // [batch_size] or nullptr = legacy
) {
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Route KV reads through the descriptor**

Immediately after `const int seq_len = ...` in the kernel body, insert:

```c
    // One code path for both modes: in legacy mode we synthesise a descriptor
    // with zero bases, so the address arithmetic below is unchanged and the
    // output is bitwise identical to the pre-SP1 kernel.
    const int slot = (row_slot != nullptr) ? row_slot[b] : 0;
    const KvSlotDesc desc = (slot_descs != nullptr)
        ? slot_descs[slot]
        : kv_slot_legacy(seq_len, max_seq);
    const int per_pos_bytes = n_kv_heads * (head_dim / 32) * 34;
```

Then replace the K read at the `Phase 1` loop:

```c
            const unsigned char* blk = k_cache
                + kv_offset_for_k(desc, t, per_pos_bytes)
                + (kv_head_block_start + bi) * 34;
```

Apply the identical substitution to the V read later in the kernel, using `kv_offset_for_v` and `v_cache`.

Also override `seq_len` when a descriptor is present, since the slot's own length is authoritative:

```c
    const int eff_seq_len = (slot_descs != nullptr) ? desc.seq_len : seq_len;
```

and use `eff_seq_len` in place of `seq_len` in every loop bound *except* the shared-memory pointer arithmetic (`workspace = sdata + seq_len`), which must keep using the launch-wide value so per-row LDS slices stay within the allocation.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the launcher variant**

In `crates/rdna-compute/src/attention.rs`, rename the existing body to `attention_q8_0_kv_batched_masked_slots` with two extra trailing parameters, and push them onto both the `params` vector and the `KernargBlob`:

```rust
        let mut desc_ptr: *mut std::ffi::c_void = match slot_descs {
            Some(t) => t.buf.as_ptr(),
            None => std::ptr::null_mut(),
        };
        let mut rs_ptr: *mut std::ffi::c_void = match row_slot {
            Some(t) => t.buf.as_ptr(),
            None => std::ptr::null_mut(),
        };
```

appended to `params` after `bc`, and in the blob closure after `b.push_i32(bc)`:

```rust
                b.push_ptr(desc_raw);
                b.push_ptr(rs_raw);
```

Then keep the original entry point as a thin delegate:

```rust
    /// Legacy single-sequence entry point. Preserved so existing call sites
    /// are untouched; passes null descriptors, which the kernel treats as
    /// legacy mode with bitwise-identical output.
    #[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]
    pub fn attention_q8_0_kv_batched_masked(
        &mut self,
        q: &GpuTensor,
        k_cache: &GpuTensor,
        v_cache: &GpuTensor,
        out: &GpuTensor,
        positions: &GpuTensor,
        n_heads: usize,
        n_kv_heads: usize,
        head_dim: usize,
        max_seq: usize,
        max_ctx_len: usize,
        batch_size: usize,
        tree_bias: Option<&GpuTensor>,
        block_start: usize,
        block_cols: usize,
    ) -> HipResult<()> {
        self.attention_q8_0_kv_batched_masked_slots(
            q, k_cache, v_cache, out, positions, n_heads, n_kv_heads, head_dim,
            max_seq, max_ctx_len, batch_size, tree_bias, block_start, block_cols,
            None, None,
        )
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Build**

Run: `cargo build --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet`
Expected: compiles clean, no changes needed at any existing call site.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify legacy mode is bitwise identical**

Run: `cargo run --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet --example test_q8_flash_prefill`
Expected: same pass output as on a clean `origin/beta` checkout. Capture both and compare:

```bash
./scripts/attn_legacy_baseline.sh > /tmp/after.txt 2>&1
diff scripts/attn_legacy_baseline.beta.txt /tmp/after.txt && echo LEGACY_BITWISE_IDENTICAL
```

`scripts/attn_legacy_baseline.beta.txt` is a **committed fingerprint captured
from pristine `origin/beta` code** across 11 shapes covering both models'
head configurations (GQA 8:1 and 6:1) plus awkward context/row counts. It is
verified deterministic across runs.

Do **NOT** try to regenerate the "before" side with `git stash` — the SP1
changes are committed, not staged, so stashing would not revert them, and
stashing inside a working worktree risks losing work. The committed fingerprint
is the reference; if you believe it is wrong, stop and escalate rather than
regenerating it from modified code.
Expected: `BITWISE_IDENTICAL`.

If they differ, stop. A legacy-mode change means the descriptor path leaked into the null case, and every later task builds on this being clean.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add kernels/src/attention_q8_0_kv_batched.hip crates/rdna-compute/src/attention.rs
git commit -m "feat(attn): slot descriptors for the Q8 LDS batched kernel

Null descriptor = legacy mode, verified bitwise identical."
```

### Task 5: Port `attention_flash_q8_0_tile_batched` and the shared launcher

> **Invariant surfaced by the Task 4 review — `desc.seq_len <= launch-wide seq_len`.**
> The ported kernels use the slot's own `desc.seq_len` for loop bounds but keep
> LDS slice pointers on the launch-wide value, so per-row scratch stays inside
> its allocation. That split is only safe while `desc.seq_len <= seq_len`. If a
> descriptor ever reports a longer length than the launch was sized for,
> `scores[t]` writes land in the `workspace`/`q_shared` region and corrupt that
> row's own reduction — silently, with no crash. Task 4 could not exercise this
> (all its call sites pass null). **Any task that passes real descriptors must
> either enforce this invariant at the launcher or cover it with a test where a
> slot's `seq_len` differs from `positions[b] + 1`.**

> **Header inclusion — read before editing any `.hip` file.** Kernels are
> compiled at **runtime** by `hipcc` in a cache directory with **no `-I` to
> `kernels/src`**, so a literal `#include "kv_slot_desc.h"` does not resolve.
> Task 4 established the pattern, matching what the codebase already does for
> `turbo_common.h` / `givens_common.h`: keep the `#include` line in the `.hip`
> source for readability, then in Rust **strip that directive and prepend the
> header body** before compiling, via `kernels::KV_SLOT_DESC_H`
> (`format!("{}\n{}", kernels::KV_SLOT_DESC_H, stripped)`). There are **two**
> independent compile sites that must both be updated or the second breaks
> silently at first real precompile: the lazy `ensure_kernel` path, and the
> `precompile_qwen35` spec list in `crates/rdna-compute/src/dispatch.rs`.
> See commit `a01838e9` for the worked example.

This is the long-context path — the one that actually runs at agent context lengths, since `LDS_CTX_LIMIT = 15000`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `kernels/src/attention_flash_q8_0_tile_batched.hip`
- Modify: `crates/rdna-compute/src/attention.rs:3437+` (`launch_asym_flash_batched`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 2's header; Task 3's Rust mirror.
- Produces: `launch_asym_flash_batched` gains trailing `slot_descs: Option<&GpuTensor>, row_slot: Option<&GpuTensor>` parameters; `Gpu::attention_flash_q8_0_batched_masked_slots(...)` exposes them. All six existing asym/fwht wrappers pass `None, None` unchanged.

**Note:** the tile kernel's grid is `[n_heads, max_tiles, chunk]` and the launcher already loops over `batch_offset` when `partials` capacity forces sub-batching. The `row_slot` lookup must therefore use the **global** row index `batch_offset + blockIdx.z`, not `blockIdx.z` alone. Getting this wrong produces correct results at small batch and silent cross-slot corruption at large batch — precisely the bug Task 7's isolation test exists to catch.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the descriptor args to the tile kernel**

In `kernels/src/attention_flash_q8_0_tile_batched.hip`, add `#include "kv_slot_desc.h"`, then append to the signature after `int window`:

```c
    int window,                                // sliding-window span; <= 0 = full causal
    const KvSlotDesc* __restrict__ slot_descs, // [n_slots] or nullptr = legacy
    const int* __restrict__ row_slot           // [total_batch] or nullptr = legacy
) {
```

In the body, after the existing row index is computed, add:

```c
    // batch_offset is the sub-batch base the launcher is currently emitting.
    // row_slot is indexed by GLOBAL row, so it must include that offset —
    // using the local index silently reads the wrong slot once the partials
    // buffer forces sub-batching.
    const int global_row = batch_offset + (int)blockIdx.z;
    const int slot = (row_slot != nullptr) ? row_slot[global_row] : 0;
    const KvSlotDesc desc = (slot_descs != nullptr)
        ? slot_descs[slot]
        : kv_slot_legacy(positions[global_row] + 1, max_seq);
    const int per_pos_bytes = n_kv_heads * (head_dim / 32) * 34;
```

Replace every `k_cache + (size_t)<pos> * ...` with `k_cache + kv_offset_for_k(desc, <pos>, per_pos_bytes) + <head-block offset>`, and the same for `v_cache` with `kv_offset_for_v`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Thread the parameters through the shared launcher**

In `launch_asym_flash_batched`, add two trailing parameters:

```rust
        slot_descs: Option<&GpuTensor>,
        row_slot: Option<&GpuTensor>,
```

Push them as the last two kernargs in the non-WMMA branch only. The WMMA branch omits `v_mode_bits` and has its own kernarg layout — leave it untouched and assert it is not reached with descriptors:

```rust
        assert!(
            !(use_wmma_grid && slot_descs.is_some()),
            "multi-slot descriptors are not supported on the WMMA tile grid; \
             the WMMA kernarg layout differs and asym4-WMMA is out of SP1 scope"
        );
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Update all existing callers of the shared launcher**

Every current caller — `attention_flash_q8_0_batched_masked`, `attention_flash_asym3_batched`, `attention_flash_asym3_batched_masked`, `attention_flash_asym2_batched`, `attention_flash_asym4_batched`, `attention_flash_asym4_batched_masked`, `attention_flash_fwht{2,3,4}_batched*`, and the windowed variant — gains `None, None` at the end of its call.

Run this to enumerate them so none is missed:
```bash
grep -n "launch_asym_flash_batched(" crates/rdna-compute/src/attention.rs
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the slots entry point**

```rust
    /// Multi-slot Q8_0 tiled flash attention. `slot_descs` is `[n_slots]`
    /// `KvSlotDesc`; `row_slot` is `[batch_size]` slot indices per query row.
    /// Passing `None` for both is exactly the legacy single-sequence path.
    #[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]
    pub fn attention_flash_q8_0_batched_masked_slots(
        &mut self,
        q: &GpuTensor,
        k_cache: &GpuTensor,
        v_cache: &GpuTensor,
        out: &GpuTensor,
        positions: &GpuTensor,
        n_heads: usize,
        n_kv_heads: usize,
        head_dim: usize,
        max_seq: usize,
        max_ctx_len: usize,
        batch_size: usize,
        partials: &GpuTensor,
        tree_bias: Option<&GpuTensor>,
        block_start: usize,
        block_cols: usize,
        slot_descs: Option<&GpuTensor>,
        row_slot: Option<&GpuTensor>,
    ) -> HipResult<()> {
        self.launch_asym_flash_batched(
            "attention_flash_q8_0_tile_batched",
            kernels::ATTENTION_FLASH_Q8_0_TILE_BATCHED_SRC,
            "attention_flash_q8_0_tile_batched",
            q, k_cache, v_cache, out, positions, q, q,
            n_heads, n_kv_heads, head_dim, max_seq, max_ctx_len, batch_size,
            partials, tree_bias, block_start, block_cols, 0, -1, false,
            slot_descs, row_slot,
        )
    }
```

Match the exact argument order of the existing `attention_flash_q8_0_batched_masked` body — copy it and add the two trailing arguments rather than retyping from this plan, since the `cos_theta`/`sin_theta` dummies and `v_mode_bits` value must stay as they are.

- [ ] **Step 5: Build and verify legacy is unchanged**

Run:
```bash
cargo build --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet
cargo run --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet --example q8_batched_attn_microbench > /tmp/mb_after.txt 2>&1
```
Expected: builds clean; the microbench still runs and reports both arms.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add kernels/src/attention_flash_q8_0_tile_batched.hip crates/rdna-compute/src/attention.rs
git commit -m "feat(attn): slot descriptors on the shared asym/q8 tile launcher

row_slot is indexed by GLOBAL row so sub-batching cannot desync it.
WMMA grid asserted out of scope — different kernarg layout."
```

### Task 6: Port `attention_flash_asym3_tile_batched` and `attention_q8_0_flash_prefill`

> **Read this before touching either kernel — corrected by the Task 5 review.**
> `positions[row] + 1` is the **per-row causal bound**; `desc.seq_len` is the
> **slot's logical KV length**. They differ whenever a slot has more than one
> query row (a slot verifying M draft tokens has rows at p, p+1, … p+M−1, and
> row 0 must not see row 2's key). **`positions[]` stays authoritative for the
> causal window. The descriptor supplies the slab BASE ADDRESS only.** Do not
> derive tile counts or loop bounds from `desc.seq_len`.
>
> Task 5 got this wrong and it was Critical: the tile kernel bounded itself by
> `desc.seq_len` while `attention_flash_asym_reduce_batched` still bounded
> itself by `positions[]`, so the reduce folded stale partials — from a previous
> sub-batch chunk or a previous layer — into the output, guarded only by a
> `p[1] > 0.0f` check that stale data usually passes. A negative control
> reproduced it at `max_abs=4.8e-3`. The asym3 tile kernel shares that same
> reduce kernel, so the identical trap is live here.
>
> Also carry over from Task 5: assert `slot_descs.is_some() == row_slot.is_some()`
> (the half-configured combination silently pins every row to slot 0), and assert
> `tree_bias.is_none()` when descriptors are present (out of SP1 scope).

Two kernels, one task: asym3 rides the launcher already modified in Task 5, so its change is confined to the `.hip` file, and the prefill kernel is the same mechanical edit against a different grid.

**Files:**
- Modify: `kernels/src/attention_flash_asym3_tile_batched.hip`
- Modify: `kernels/src/attention_q8_0_flash_prefill.hip`
- Modify: `crates/rdna-compute/src/attention.rs` (prefill launcher at `:1822`; asym3 wrapper at `:3788`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Tasks 2, 3, 5.
- Produces: `Gpu::attention_flash_asym3_batched_masked_slots(...)` and `Gpu::attention_q8_0_flash_prefill_slots(..., slot_descs, tile_slot, tile_row0)`.

**asym3 stride note:** asym3 K is *not* 34-byte Q8_0 blocks — it is 3-bit Givens-rotated. Its per-position K stride differs from V's, which stays Q8_0. Find both before editing:

```bash
grep -n "k_cache +\|v_cache +\|per_pos\|stride" kernels/src/attention_flash_asym3_tile_batched.hip
```

Reuse the kernel's own existing stride expressions verbatim as the `per_pos_bytes` arguments — pass the K stride to `kv_offset_for_k` and the V stride to `kv_offset_for_v`. Do **not** copy the Q8 value of `n_kv_heads * (head_dim/32) * 34`; using it for K would compute addresses roughly 2.7× too large and read past the arena.

**Prefill grid note:** the prefill kernel's grid is `[batch.div_ceil(br), n_heads]`, so `blockIdx.x` is the tile index. Use `tile_slot[blockIdx.x]` and `tile_row0[blockIdx.x]` — this is the kernel that genuinely needs the tile arrays from Task 3, because BR > 1 there.

- [ ] **Step 1: Port the asym3 tile kernel**

Add `#include "kv_slot_desc.h"` and the same two trailing parameters as Task 5 Step 1. Compute `slot`/`desc` from `batch_offset + blockIdx.z` exactly as in Task 5. Replace the K and V base addressing with `kv_offset_for_k` / `kv_offset_for_v`, using the kernel's own existing per-position stride expression for `per_pos_bytes`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the asym3 slots wrapper**

Copy the body of the existing `attention_flash_asym3_batched_masked` into a `_slots` variant with trailing `slot_descs` / `row_slot`, forwarding them to `launch_asym_flash_batched`; make the original delegate with `None, None`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Port the prefill kernel**

In `kernels/src/attention_q8_0_flash_prefill.hip`, add `#include "kv_slot_desc.h"` and three trailing parameters:

```c
    const KvSlotDesc* __restrict__ slot_descs,  // [n_slots] or nullptr
    const int* __restrict__ tile_slot,          // [n_tiles] or nullptr
    const int* __restrict__ tile_row0           // [n_tiles] or nullptr
) {
```

In the body, where the tile's first query row is currently derived from `blockIdx.x * BR`:

```c
    const int tile = blockIdx.x;
    const int slot = (tile_slot != nullptr) ? tile_slot[tile] : 0;
    // Legacy: row0 = tile * BR. Multi-slot: the builder supplies it, because
    // tiles restart at 0 for each slot.
    const int row0 = (tile_row0 != nullptr) ? tile_row0[tile] : (tile * BR);
    const KvSlotDesc desc = (slot_descs != nullptr)
        ? slot_descs[slot]
        : kv_slot_legacy(0, max_ctx_len);
    const int per_pos_bytes = n_kv_heads * (head_dim / 32) * 34;
```

and route the K/V tile reads through `kv_offset_for_k` / `kv_offset_for_v`.

**Careful — the two row indices are different.** KV addressing is slot-relative, but `q` and `out` are indexed by the *global* flat row. `tile_row0[t]` is slot-relative; `tile_qbase[t]` (already produced by Task 3) is the global one. Add a fourth kernel parameter for it:

```c
    const int* __restrict__ tile_qbase          // [n_tiles] or nullptr
) {
```

and in the body:

```c
    // Slot-relative row, for causal masking against this slot's own history.
    const int row0 = (tile_row0 != nullptr) ? tile_row0[tile] : (tile * BR);
    // Global flat row, for indexing q and out. In legacy mode these coincide.
    const int qbase = (tile_qbase != nullptr) ? tile_qbase[tile] : (tile * BR);
```

Use `qbase` for every `q`/`out` offset and `row0` only where the query's position within its own sequence matters. Conflating them leaves slot 0 correct and every later slot reading the wrong query — a bug that Task 7's golden test catches only because its slots hold *distinct* data.

- [ ] **Step 4: Build the slots entry point for prefill**

Add `Gpu::attention_q8_0_flash_prefill_slots(...)` taking trailing `slot_descs`, `tile_slot`, `tile_row0`, `tile_qbase` as `Option<&GpuTensor>`, with the existing `attention_q8_0_flash_prefill` delegating with four `None`s. The grid becomes `[n_tiles, n_heads]` where `n_tiles = tile_slot.len()` in multi-slot mode and `batch_size.div_ceil(br)` in legacy mode.

Run: `cargo test --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet kv_slots`
Expected: PASS, 7 tests (unchanged from Task 3 — this task adds no new host-side tests).

- [ ] **Step 5: Build and check legacy prefill is unchanged**

Run:
```bash
cargo build --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet
./scripts/attn_legacy_baseline.sh > /tmp/after6.txt 2>&1
diff scripts/attn_legacy_baseline.beta.txt /tmp/after6.txt && echo LEGACY_UNCHANGED
```
Expected: `LEGACY_UNCHANGED` against the Task 4 Step 5 baseline.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add kernels/src/attention_flash_asym3_tile_batched.hip kernels/src/attention_q8_0_flash_prefill.hip crates/rdna-compute/src/attention.rs
git commit -m "feat(attn): slot descriptors for asym3 tile and Q8 flash prefill

Prefill takes both tile_row0 (slot-relative, for causal masking) and
tile_qbase (global flat row, for q/out indexing)."
```

### Task 7: Correctness harness — golden, isolation, adversarial shapes

> **Invariant surfaced by the Task 4 review — `desc.seq_len <= launch-wide seq_len`.**
> The ported kernels use the slot's own `desc.seq_len` for loop bounds but keep
> LDS slice pointers on the launch-wide value, so per-row scratch stays inside
> its allocation. That split is only safe while `desc.seq_len <= seq_len`. If a
> descriptor ever reports a longer length than the launch was sized for,
> `scores[t]` writes land in the `workspace`/`q_shared` region and corrupt that
> row's own reduction — silently, with no crash. Task 4 could not exercise this
> (all its call sites pass null). **Any task that passes real descriptors must
> either enforce this invariant at the launcher or cover it with a test where a
> slot's `seq_len` differs from `positions[b] + 1`.**

The gate for the whole sub-project. Spec §9.

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/rdna-compute/examples/test_batched_attn_slots.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: every `_slots` entry point from Tasks 4–6; `build_tiles` from Task 3.
- Produces: a pass/fail harness. No code consumed downstream.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the golden-equivalence test**

First add the arena builder to `crates/rdna-compute/src/kv_slots.rs` so Task 8's benchmark uses the *same* layout as this correctness gate — two harnesses that disagree about the arena would measure and verify different things:

```rust
/// Build one KV arena holding `seq_lens.len()` contiguous slabs and the
/// matching descriptor table. Each slab is `cap` tokens; `cap` is rounded up
/// so a future page size divides it (spec §6.4).
///
/// `poison_except`: when `Some(target)`, every slab other than `target` is
/// filled with NaN-producing bytes. Used by the isolation test.
///
/// Slab contents vary by slot index — identical slabs would let a cross-slot
/// addressing bug pass by symmetry.
pub fn build_arena(
    seq_lens: &[usize],
    per_pos_bytes: usize,
    poison_except: Option<usize>,
) -> (Vec<u8>, Vec<KvSlotDesc>) {
    const PAGE_TOKENS: usize = 128; // == TILE_SIZE, so pages divide slabs later
    let mut arena = Vec::new();
    let mut descs = Vec::with_capacity(seq_lens.len());
    for (slot, &sl) in seq_lens.iter().enumerate() {
        let cap = sl.div_ceil(PAGE_TOKENS) * PAGE_TOKENS;
        let base = arena.len() as u64;
        let poisoned = poison_except.is_some_and(|t| t != slot);
        for blk_idx in 0..(cap * per_pos_bytes / 34) {
            // f16 scale: 0x7E00 is NaN; otherwise a per-slot varying value.
            let (lo, hi) = if poisoned {
                (0x00u8, 0x7Eu8)
            } else {
                let h = half_from_f32(0.02 + (((blk_idx + slot * 7) % 13) as f32) * 0.005);
                ((h & 0xFF) as u8, (h >> 8) as u8)
            };
            arena.push(lo);
            arena.push(hi);
            for j in 0..32 {
                arena.push((((blk_idx * 31 + j * 17 + slot * 101) % 251) as i32 - 125) as i8 as u8);
            }
        }
        descs.push(KvSlotDesc {
            k_base: base,
            v_base: base, // K and V arenas are separate buffers, same offsets
            seq_len: sl as i32,
            cap: cap as i32,
        });
    }
    (arena, descs)
}
```

`half_from_f32` already exists in `crates/rdna-compute/examples/test_q8_flash_prefill.rs`; move it into `kv_slots.rs` as a `pub fn` and have the example use it from there rather than keeping two copies.

Then create `crates/rdna-compute/examples/test_batched_attn_slots.rs`. For a given `(n_slots, per-slot seq_len, per-slot M)` shape it must:

1. Call `build_arena` for K and V.
2. For each slot, call the legacy single-sequence kernel against that slot's slab in isolation, collecting reference outputs.
3. Build `descs` / `row_slot` / `positions` and make one batched multi-slot call.
4. Compare, requiring `max |batched - reference| <= 1e-3 * max(1.0, |reference|)`.

```rust
fn assert_close(label: &str, got: &[f32], want: &[f32]) {
    assert_eq!(got.len(), want.len(), "{label}: length mismatch");
    let mut worst = 0.0f32;
    let mut worst_i = 0usize;
    for (i, (g, w)) in got.iter().zip(want).enumerate() {
        let tol = 1e-3 * w.abs().max(1.0);
        let err = (g - w).abs() / tol;
        if err > worst {
            worst = err;
            worst_i = i;
        }
    }
    assert!(
        worst <= 1.0,
        "{label}: worst element {worst_i} at {worst:.2}x tolerance \
         (got {}, want {})",
        got[worst_i], want[worst_i]
    );
    println!("  {label}: OK (worst {worst:.3}x tolerance)");
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the cross-slot isolation test**

The sharpest instrument in the plan — it catches descriptor and stride bugs directly.

```rust
/// Fill every slot except `target` with NaN, then confirm `target`'s output is
/// unchanged. A wrong k_base, a wrong stride, or an off-by-one seq_len will
/// pull a NaN in and the comparison explodes immediately.
///
/// NaN is used rather than a large finite value on purpose: NaN propagates
/// through the softmax instead of being suppressed by the running max, so a
/// single leaked element is unmissable.
fn test_cross_slot_isolation(gpu: &mut Gpu, shape: &Shape) {
    let clean = run_batched(gpu, shape, /*poison=*/ None);
    for target in 0..shape.n_slots {
        let poisoned = run_batched(gpu, shape, Some(target));
        let a = slot_output(&clean, shape, target);
        let b = slot_output(&poisoned, shape, target);
        assert!(
            b.iter().all(|v| v.is_finite()),
            "slot {target}: NaN leaked in from a neighbouring slot"
        );
        assert_close(&format!("isolation slot {target}"), &b, &a);
    }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the adversarial-shape sweep**

```rust
struct Shape {
    n_slots: usize,
    seq_lens: Vec<usize>,
    m_per_slot: Vec<usize>,
    n_heads: usize,
    n_kv_heads: usize,
    head_dim: usize,
}

fn shapes() -> Vec<Shape> {
    let mut v = Vec::new();
    // GQA 8:1 — qwen3.6-35b-a3b full-attention layers.
    // GQA 6:1 — qwen3.6-27b full-attention layers.
    for &(nh, nkv) in &[(16usize, 2usize), (24, 4)] {
        // Wildly unequal context in one batch.
        v.push(Shape { n_slots: 4, seq_lens: vec![1, 512, 8192, 100_000],
                       m_per_slot: vec![1, 1, 1, 1], n_heads: nh, n_kv_heads: nkv, head_dim: 256 });
        // Mixed M: a zero-query slot, a decode, a small verify, a big verify.
        v.push(Shape { n_slots: 4, seq_lens: vec![4096, 4096, 4096, 4096],
                       m_per_slot: vec![0, 1, 3, 8], n_heads: nh, n_kv_heads: nkv, head_dim: 256 });
        // Mixed prefill + decode — the batch shape SP1 exists for.
        v.push(Shape { n_slots: 4, seq_lens: vec![32_768, 1024, 512, 512],
                       m_per_slot: vec![8, 256, 1, 1], n_heads: nh, n_kv_heads: nkv, head_dim: 256 });
        // seq_len below TILE_SIZE, and non-multiples of BR/BC.
        v.push(Shape { n_slots: 3, seq_lens: vec![7, 129, 131],
                       m_per_slot: vec![1, 5, 1], n_heads: nh, n_kv_heads: nkv, head_dim: 256 });
        // Slot-count sweep 1..=8 at a fixed modest context.
        for n in 1..=8usize {
            v.push(Shape { n_slots: n, seq_lens: vec![2048; n], m_per_slot: vec![1; n],
                           n_heads: nh, n_kv_heads: nkv, head_dim: 256 });
        }
    }
    v
}
```

Each shape runs golden equivalence and isolation, for **both** KV modes.

- [ ] **Step 4: Assert the asym3 arm is really asym3**

Guards the §4.4 trap — a silent fall back to q8 would make an unimplemented asym3 path pass everything.

```rust
// The asym3 arm allocates a 3-bit-K arena. If the code under test were
// silently running the Q8 path it would read 34-byte blocks out of a
// smaller buffer and produce garbage, not a clean pass — but assert the
// byte budget explicitly so the intent is recorded and a future refactor
// cannot quietly reintroduce the fallback.
assert!(
    asym3_bytes_per_pos < q8_bytes_per_pos,
    "asym3 arena is not smaller than Q8 — the asym3 path is not active \
     (see spec §4.4: QWEN35_PARO_POLICY silently downgrades asym3 to q8)"
);
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the harness**

Run: `cargo run --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet --example test_batched_attn_slots`
Expected: every shape prints `OK` for golden and isolation on both KV modes, then a final `ALL SHAPES PASS` line.

The most likely failure is the Task 5 global-row bug: correct at small batch, wrong once `partials` capacity forces sub-batching. If isolation fails only at larger `n_slots`, look there first.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/rdna-compute/examples/test_batched_attn_slots.rs crates/rdna-compute/src/kv_slots.rs crates/rdna-compute/examples/test_q8_flash_prefill.rs
git commit -m "test(attn): golden, cross-slot isolation and adversarial shapes

NaN-poison isolation is the sharp instrument for descriptor and stride
bugs; golden equivalence is tolerance-based because tiling reorders
accumulation."
```

### Task 8: Multi-slot benchmark and `TILE_SIZE` sweep

Spec §10.

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/rdna-compute/examples/q8_batched_attn_microbench.rs`
- Create: `docs/perf-checkpoints/2026-08-07-multislot-attention-bench.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the `_slots` entry points.
- Produces: measured `TILE_SIZE` default and the batched-vs-sequential curve. No code consumed downstream.

- [ ] **Step 1: Make `TILE_SIZE` overridable**

In `crates/rdna-compute/src/attention.rs`, replace `const TILE_SIZE: usize = 128;` inside `launch_asym_flash_batched` with:

```rust
        // gfx1151 is the dev box; gfx1201 is the target. Never bake a tuned
        // constant into a `const` — see spec §11.
        let tile_size: usize = std::env::var("HIPFIRE_ATTN_TILE_SIZE")
            .ok()
            .and_then(|v| v.parse().ok())
            .filter(|&t: &usize| t > 0 && t % 32 == 0)
            .unwrap_or(128);
```

and replace every use of `TILE_SIZE` in that function with `tile_size`. The LDS request `(TILE_SIZE * 4) as u32` becomes `(tile_size * 4) as u32`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the multi-slot sweep arm**

Append to `crates/rdna-compute/examples/q8_batched_attn_microbench.rs`, reusing the existing `time` closure defined at line 88:

```rust
    // ── Multi-slot sweep: batched vs sequential ─────────────────────────────
    // (A) one batched launch over n_slots, versus
    // (B) n_slots sequential single-slot launches.
    // Spec §2 criterion 2: batched must beat sequential at every n_slots >= 2.
    // A regression here is a failure, not a tuning outcome.
    for &n_slots in &[1usize, 2, 4, 8] {
        let per_slot_ctx = env_usize("SLOT_CTX", 32768);
        let shape = vec![per_slot_ctx; n_slots];
        let (batched_ms, seq_ms) = bench_slots(&mut gpu, &shape, &vec![1usize; n_slots]);
        println!(
            "n_slots={n_slots:2} ctx={per_slot_ctx:6} : batched {batched_ms:8.3} ms  \
             sequential {seq_ms:8.3} ms  speedup {:.2}x",
            seq_ms / batched_ms
        );
        if n_slots >= 2 {
            assert!(
                batched_ms < seq_ms,
                "batched ({batched_ms:.3} ms) must beat sequential \
                 ({seq_ms:.3} ms) at n_slots={n_slots} — spec §2 criterion 2"
            );
        }
    }

    // Ragged batch: max_tiles is derived from the batch MAXIMUM context, so
    // short slots launch tiles that immediately early-exit. Measure that waste
    // rather than assuming it is negligible (spec §7).
    {
        let ragged = vec![1024usize, 4096, 32768, 100_000];
        let uniform = vec![100_000usize; 4];
        let (ragged_ms, _) = bench_slots(&mut gpu, &ragged, &vec![1usize; 4]);
        let (uniform_ms, _) = bench_slots(&mut gpu, &uniform, &vec![1usize; 4]);
        let useful: usize = ragged.iter().sum();
        let launched = 100_000 * 4;
        println!(
            "ragged {ragged_ms:8.3} ms vs uniform-max {uniform_ms:8.3} ms  \
             (useful KV {useful}, tiles sized for {launched}, \
              waste {:.1}%)",
            100.0 * (1.0 - useful as f64 / launched as f64)
        );
    }
```

with this helper above `main`, built on `kv_slots::build_arena` and `kv_slots::build_tiles` from Task 7 — the bench and the correctness gate must share one arena layout or they are measuring and verifying different things:

    });

    (batched, sequential)
}
```

Both arms now time kernel launches only. If you need to restructure this for borrow-checker reasons, preserve that property — it is the whole basis of the criterion-2 comparison.

- [ ] **Step 2b: Record the LDS-vs-tile crossover for multi-slot batches**

Required by spec §2 criterion 3 and spec §7. The LDS path's grid is `[n_heads, batch_size]` — only 64 workgroups at `n_heads=16, N=4, M=1` — while the tile path is already massively parallel. Below `LDS_CTX_LIMIT` the router picks LDS, and that may be the wrong choice once several slots are batched.

```rust
    // Which path wins below the crossover, at multi-slot batch? The router
    // sends ctx < LDS_CTX_LIMIT (15000) to the LDS kernel, whose grid is
    // [n_heads, batch] — thin. Measure both paths at the same shape rather
    // than assuming the existing single-sequence crossover still holds.
    for &ctx in &[2048usize, 8192, 14000] {
        for &n_slots in &[1usize, 4, 8] {
            let lds_ms = bench_lds_path(&mut gpu, ctx, n_slots);
            let tile_ms = bench_tile_path(&mut gpu, ctx, n_slots);
            println!(
                "ctx={ctx:6} n_slots={n_slots:2} : LDS {lds_ms:8.3} ms  \
                 tile {tile_ms:8.3} ms  winner={}",
                if lds_ms < tile_ms { "LDS" } else { "TILE" }
            );
        }
    }
```

Do **not** change `LDS_CTX_LIMIT` in this task. Record the finding; changing the router for multi-slot batches is an SP3 scheduler decision and needs its own review.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the 32 GB budget assertion**

Mandatory per spec §10 — this box has ~125 GiB of shared memory and would otherwise pass an over-budget design that OOMs on the R9700.

```rust
// This box has ~125 GiB shared; the target R9700 has 32 GB. Without this
// assertion an over-budget configuration passes here and OOMs on target.
const R9700_VRAM_BYTES: u64 = 32 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024;
let budget = std::env::var("HIPFIRE_VRAM_BUDGET_BYTES")
    .ok()
    .and_then(|v| v.parse().ok())
    .unwrap_or(R9700_VRAM_BYTES);
assert!(
    total_alloc_bytes <= budget,
    "configuration needs {:.2} GiB but the R9700 target has {:.2} GiB",
    total_alloc_bytes as f64 / 1073741824.0,
    budget as f64 / 1073741824.0
);
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the sweep**

Run:
```bash
for ts in 64 128 256; do
  echo "=== TILE_SIZE=$ts ==="
  HIPFIRE_ATTN_TILE_SIZE=$ts cargo run --release -p rdna-compute --features deltanet --example q8_batched_attn_microbench
done
```
Expected: batched beats sequential at every `n_slots >= 2`. Per spec §2 criterion 2, a regression against the sequential baseline is a failure, not a tuning outcome.

- [ ] **Step 5: Write the results note**

Create `docs/perf-checkpoints/2026-08-07-multislot-attention-bench.md` with: the batched-vs-sequential table per `n_slots` and KV mode; the `TILE_SIZE` sweep and the chosen default with its justification; the LDS-vs-tile crossover table from Step 2b, with a recommendation for SP3 on whether the multi-slot router should differ from the single-sequence one; the ragged-batch waste measurement; and an explicit statement that these are **gfx1151** numbers and may not transfer to gfx1201.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/rdna-compute/src/attention.rs crates/rdna-compute/examples/q8_batched_attn_microbench.rs docs/perf-checkpoints/2026-08-07-multislot-attention-bench.md
git commit -m "perf(attn): multi-slot bench, TILE_SIZE sweep, 32GB budget gate"

### Task 9: asym3 quality gate

> **MEMORY — this is the heaviest task in the plan; read before running anything.**
> Task 9 loads *real models*: `qwen3.6-27b.mq4` (15 GB) and
> `qwen3.6-35b-a3b.mq4r` (18.7 GB), each in two KV modes. That dwarfs every
> other task's footprint, and this box has **no swap** with GPU memory coming
> out of system RAM.
> - **One model at a time. Never two loaded concurrently, and never while any
>   other GPU task is running.** Check with `pgrep -a -f "cargo run|hipfire"`
>   before starting, and wait rather than overlapping.
> - **Run every model invocation through `scripts/run-bounded.sh`**, raising the
>   cap deliberately for this task since the models are genuinely large:
>   `HIPFIRE_MEM_CAP=28G ./scripts/run-bounded.sh …`. Exit 137 means shrink the
>   run (shorter context, fewer prompts), not raise the cap further.
> - **Preflight before each load:** require `MemAvailable` comfortably above the
>   model size plus KV plus headroom. Skip and report rather than pushing.
> - Between arms, make sure the previous process has fully exited before
>   starting the next — a lingering daemon holding a model is how two models end
>   up resident at once. See the stale-daemon hazard: `hipfire serve` uses
>   `~/.hipfire/bin/daemon`, which can outlive an apparent exit.
> - After each arm, check `journalctl -k --since "<start>" | grep -E 'Out of
>   memory|oom-kill|page allocation failure'` and report the count. A live
>   `free` will not reveal damage after the fact.

Spec §13. asym3 is not what these models ship with; this decides whether it may become a batched default.

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/perf-checkpoints/2026-08-07-asym3-quality-gate.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing from earlier tasks — this measures model quality, not kernel correctness.
- Produces: a recorded verdict. Blocks spec §2 criterion 5.

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm the resolved KV mode on both arms**

Run each model once per arm and capture the carrier's `KV cache:` log line. Per spec §4.4, `HIPFIRE_KV_MODE=asym3` silently yields q8 on the PaRo loader path, which would make the whole gate meaningless.

```bash
for m in qwen3.6:27b qwen3.6:35b-a3b; do
  for kv in q8 asym3; do
    echo "--- $m / $kv ---"
    HIPFIRE_LOCAL=1 HIPFIRE_KV_MODE=$kv hipfire run "$m" "hi" 2>&1 | grep -i "KV cache"
  done
done
```
Expected: for each model the two lines differ, and the `asym3` line names asym3. If they match, **stop** — `QWEN35_PARO_POLICY` has silently downgraded asym3 to q8 (spec §4.4) and the gate would be comparing q8 against q8.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the KLD comparison**

Use the existing tooling: `benchmarks/quality-baselines/harness/kld_reduce.py` and `scripts/reap/kld_compare.py`. Report **mean and median** — they diverge sharply on long-tail distributions and the mean alone has misled before.

Score on the model's **own generated output**, not a reference completion; scoring against reference output flatters the quantised model.

Do **not** use synthetic filler prompts. Long prompts built from a small random vocabulary are pathologically out-of-distribution and degenerate on both arms, which reads as a quantisation failure and is not one.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the KV identicality dashboard**

Run `scripts/kv_quality_dashboard.py` over the quantisation-gate output for both arms.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run coherence at agent-realistic context**

Use the `coherence-gate-qwen35-*` scripts on real prose and code prompts at the long contexts agents actually run at — not short prompts, since rotated-K error accumulates with context.

- [ ] **Step 5: Record the verdict**

Create `docs/perf-checkpoints/2026-08-07-asym3-quality-gate.md` with the resolved-mode evidence from Step 1, the mean and median KLD per model, the dashboard summary, the coherence results, and one of three verdicts per model: asym3 becomes the batched default; asym3 stays opt-in via `HIPFIRE_KV_MODE`; or asym3 is rejected with numbers.

All three are acceptable outcomes. If asym3 is rejected for the 27B, record that spec §4.2's capacity argument fails with it and 4 agents × 128K on the 27B goes back to not fitting — the fallback is fewer agents or shorter contexts, not another compression trick.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/perf-checkpoints/2026-08-07-asym3-quality-gate.md
git commit -m "docs(attn): asym3 quality gate results

Resolved-mode evidence included per spec §4.4 — a silent q8 fallback
would make the whole comparison meaningless."
```

## Completion

SP1 is done when spec §2's five criteria hold. At that point the descriptor ABI is frozen for SP2 (multi-slot KV allocator, batched DeltaNet, batched sampling), which should get its own spec before implementation.

**What SP1 deliberately does not deliver:** an end-to-end throughput number. Three quarters of both models' layers are DeltaNet and still single-sequence, so every result here must be labelled an attention-kernel result until SP2/SP3 land.

---

## Verification notes discovered during execution

**Include paths for the Task 2 probes.** `hipcc`/`g++` resolve `#include "..."`
relative to the *probe file's own directory*, not the shell's CWD. Probes
written to `/tmp` therefore need `-I.` pointing at the repo root, or they fail
with `file not found` — which is easy to misread as the header being broken.

**The header includes `<hip/hip_runtime.h>`** (added after review, so it is
self-contained). A consequence: it can no longer be compiled by plain `g++`,
because HIP's headers `#error` unless `__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__` is defined. The
host-side `sizeof`/`alignof` check therefore needs
`-D__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__ -I/opt/rocm-7.2.2/include`, or use `hipcc` for the host
probe instead. Both routes were confirmed to print `24 8`.

**Do not mask exit codes when verifying.** `cmd 2>&1 | tail -3 && echo OK`
prints OK whenever `tail` succeeds, regardless of whether `cmd` failed. This
bit twice during execution — once on a `cargo test` run that had actually
failed to compile. Check the command's own status, or run it unpiped.
