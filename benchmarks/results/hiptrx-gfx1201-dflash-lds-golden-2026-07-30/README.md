# 27B DFlash golden run — LDS-staged weight GEMMs, gfx1201

> **Historical result.** The M4 kernel and `HIPFIRE_Q8_PREFILL_M4` switch used
> below have since been removed. These commands describe the pinned tree in the

Winning config: **`HIPFIRE_HFQ4G256_LDSSTAGE=1`, `HIPFIRE_Q8_PREFILL_M4=0`, `--ctx 2048`** → **277.97 tok/s** decode, **+9.06%** over the same binary with LDS staging off.

| arm | decode tok/s (3 fresh reps) | median | prefill | τ | accept | tokens |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| LDS off | 255.53 / 254.88 / 254.84 | 254.88 | 453.5 | 11.3846 | 0.7590 | 162 |
| **LDS on** | **278.24 / 277.97 / 276.92** | **277.97** | 466.6 | 11.3846 | 0.7590 | 162 |
| ratio | | **1.0906×** | 1.029× | | | |

τ, accept, and token count are identical to four decimals across every rep, so the arms did the same work and the delta is throughput. Spreads 0.27% / 0.47%.

Reproduces a prior +9.1% recorded on an older tree to **four digits** (1.0906 vs 1.0904), and the LDS-off arm lands 0.02% from the published golden baseline of 254.83 tok/s (`v0.2.0+3730b58`).

One binary in both arms; LDS and M4 are env flags, never rebuilds. Fixtures identified by digest, not filename.

## Reproduce

```bash
export PATH=/opt/rocm/core-7.14/bin:$PATH
cargo build --release --locked --features deltanet \
  -p hipfire-runtime --example dflash_spec_demo

export HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3
export HIPFIRE_Q8_PREFILL_M4=0        # M4 costs ~4% on the spec path
export HIPFIRE_HFQ4G256_LDSSTAGE=1    # unset for the baseline arm

./target/release/examples/dflash_spec_demo \
  --target ~/.hipfire/models/qwen3.6-27b-awq.mq4 \
  --draft  ~/.hipfire/models/qwen36-27b-dflash-mq4.hf4 \
  --prompt-file benchmarks/prompts/merge_sort_thinking_off.txt \
  --max 256 --temp 0.0 --no-chatml --kv-mode q8 --ctx 2048
```

Discard one warm-up run: the first LDS-on process JIT-compiles the two staged
kernels. Adaptive B on purpose — do **not** add `--block-size N --no-adaptive-b`,
that is a different regime (~2.3× apart) and not comparable to this line.

Routing proof, since the flag is silent when it doesn't take: an LDS-on run must
leave both objects in `$CWD/.hipfire_kernels/gfx1201/` (not under `HOME`) —
`gemm_gate_up_hfq4g256_wmma_gfx12_ldsstage.hsaco` (17 448 B) and
`gemm_hfq4g256_residual_wmma_gfx12_ldsstage.hsaco` (15 400 B).

## Caveats

- **Not bit-exact.** LDS staging reorders f32 K-accumulation (8 waves × disjoint
  64-K slices). τ/accept/output matched here, but that is one prompt at temp 0.0,
  not a quality result. The flag stays opt-in for that reason.
- **Not a serve number.** This is `dflash_spec_demo`, an isolated kernel-path
  instrument. The user-facing serve delta for this flag measured **+3.9%**.
- **`--ctx` is load-bearing.** Same 162 tokens at ctx 4096 gives 273.55 (LDS on)
  and 251.97 (LDS off) — the allocation itself costs ~1.2–1.6%, because under
  hipGraph capture `max_ctx_len` is baked as `kv_cache.physical_cap` to size the
  attention LDS for the worst case.

## Raw logs

Not committed: `benchmarks/results/RETENTION.md` excludes `**/*.log` as raw,
noisy, non-reproducible context, and `.gitignore:123` enforces it. Every
per-rep number from those logs is reproduced in the table above, so this file
is the distilled record the policy asks for.

The unedited stdout+stderr is retained on hiptrx under
`~/ctx2048-golden-dflash-ldson-m4off-2026-07-30/r{1,2,3}.log` and
`~/ctx2048-golden-dflash-ldsoff-m4off-2026-07-30/r{1,2,3}.log`, alongside the
ctx-4096 grid, the boundary sweep, and the route-rule acceptance test. The
`Reproduce` section above regenerates them from scratch.
