//! MoE kernel family: dispatching expert GEMM operations.
//!
//! Supports 3 variants:
//! - **IndexedGateUp**: gate+up projection for a single expert (indexed by token)
//! - **IndexedDown**: down projection for a single expert (indexed by token)
//! - **GroupedGemm**: batched grouped-expert GEMM (all experts in one launch)
//!
//! # Current status
//!
//! `run()` is the centralized single-token MoE decode entry — it delegates to
//! [`crate::pipeline::run_moe_decode`] (the GPU top-K fast path plus the generic
//! CPU-top-K fallback). The family owns resolution (`MoeDtypes` → `MoeResolution`);
//! the model passes only the dtype snapshot + k. One `DispatchCtx` is threaded
//! end-to-end from the call site through every inner GEMV. Scratch stays model-owned.
//! Grouped-GEMM prefill is a future arm (gated on `ShapeInfo.batch_size`).
