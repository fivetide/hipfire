//! Whole-array (8 columns x 4 core rows) signed int8 GEMM deployment.
//!
//! Output tile of core (col c, row r) in wave `(mw, nw)` is C rows `(mw*4+r)*128 ..+128`, columns
//! `(nw*8+c)*64 ..+64`; a wave therefore covers 512 x 512. `waves = (Mp/512)*(Np/512)`, wave order
//! `w = mw*NW + nw`. Host M, N are zero padded to 512; padded C is discarded by [`ArrayDesign::unpack_out`].
//!
//! Host arguments (firmware DDR-patches arg0..arg2):
//! * arg0 = A: 4 physical-row segments (`waves*kc*8192` B each), inside a segment wave, K chunk, then
//!   `(mb 0..16, kb 0..8)` 8x8 row-major blocks. The segment is repeated for every `nw` of the same `mw`
//!   (A is not replicated across columns: column `c < 4` memtile fetches segment `c` only).
//! * arg1 = B: 8 column segments (`waves*kc*4096` B each), wave, K chunk, `(kb 0..8, nb 0..8)` blocks
//!   (not replicated across rows).
//! * arg2 = C: 8 column segments (`waves*4*32768` B each), wave, core row, `(mb 0..16, nb 0..8)` blocks of
//!   8x8 row-major little-endian i32.
//!
//! Data movement (deviation from the vendor `032eb944...` design, which uses one memtile channel per A/B
//! stream with multi-dimensional BDs and different port assignment): every stream is a contiguous
//! 1-D BD; the host layout above does the reordering. Switch circuits (all circuit-switched):
//! * shim: `Mm2s0` (B) -> `North0`, `North0` -> `S2mm0` (C); columns `<4` also `Mm2s1` (A) -> `North1`.
//! * memtile: `South0` -> `Dma4` (B S2MM), `South1` -> `Dma5` (A S2MM, col<4), `Dma1` -> `North4` (B),
//!   `Dma2` -> `North5` (A, col<4), `Dma0` -> `South0` (C), `North(r)` -> `Dma(r)` (C from core row r).
//! * core row r: B `South4` -> `Dma1` and `North4` (not the top row); C `Dma0` -> `South(r)` and
//!   `North(s)` -> `South(s)` for s>r; A for row r is injected by column r (`North5` of its memtile), rides
//!   `South5` -> `North5` up column r to row r, is received on `South5` in column r, `East0` in columns <r,
//!   `West0` in columns >r, and is broadcast to `Dma0` plus `West0` (col>0, col<=r) and `East0` (col<7, col>=r).
//!   No switch master is driven by two slaves.
//!
//! Memtile (DMA own view `0x80000 + off`, locks `64 + id`): A ping 0 / pong 0x2000, B ping 0x4000 / pong
//! 0x5000, C `0x6000 + slot*0x20000 + row*0x8000` (<= 0x46000). A/B locks use the core numbering
//! (`gemm_core::A_EMPTY/A_FULL/B_EMPTY/B_FULL`), C slot/row locks are `8 + slot*8 + row*2` (empty, full+1).
//! Channel/BD banks (even channel BD<24, odd >=24): S2MM0 C0 {0,1}, S2MM1 C1 {24,25}, S2MM2 C2 {2,3}, S2MM3
//! C3 {26,27}, S2MM4 B {4,5}, S2MM5 A {28,29}; MM2S0 C chain {6..13}, MM2S1 B {30,31}, MM2S2 A {14,15}.
//! S2MM Finish-on-TLAST (`FoT_MODE`, CTRL bits16..17) remains reset-default 0 / `DMA_FoT_DISABLED`
//! (`ref/aie-rt/driver/src/global/{xaie2pgbl_params.h,xaiegbl.h}`). Completion is length-driven, so the
//! intermediate TLASTs from the joined C descriptors do not terminate the long shim output BD.
//!
//! ## V8 data movement ([`Variant::V8`], [`design_v8`]): vertical pair A-sharing, int8 SRS epilogue
//! V6 gives every core its own 8 KiB A chunk on one 32-bit stream (2048 cycles) against 1067 compute cycles
//! (A-stream bound). In V8 the cores of a vertical pair (core rows 0/1 and 2/3, physical rows 2/3 and 4/5) share
//! one 128-row A block through neighbour data memory, so every input stream of every core and every shim MM2S
//! channel carries exactly 4 KiB (1024 cycles) per K64 chunk.
//! * Geometry: column `c`, core row `rho = 2q + h` (pair `q`, half `h`: lower core `h=0`, upper core `h=1`)
//!   computes C rows `mw*512 + (2q + c%2)*128 ..+128`, columns `nw*512 + (c/2)*128 + h*64 ..+64`. A block
//!   `2q + c%2` is shared by the pair; B block `c/2` is split into its two 64-column halves, one per core of the
//!   pair. A *half* is the 8-row blocks of one parity (E: even `mb`, O: odd `mb`; `mb = 2*mb_local + parity`), per
//!   chunk 8 `mb_local` x 8 `kb` blocks of 8x8 int8 = 4 KiB. The lower core's DMA receives E, the upper core's
//!   DMA receives O; each reads the other half from its neighbour's data memory (the core program, see
//!   [`gemm_core::program_pair`]). The peer lock protocol (`PEER_FULL` / `PEER_EMPTY`) is in `gemm_core`.
//! * Host arguments: arg0 = A, 8 segments `waves*kc*4096` B by *injecting column* `c`
//!   (`(q, h, par) = (c/4, (c/2)%2, c%2)`: the half `h` of A block `2q + par`), each `(wave, chunk, 4096 B)`,
//!   repeated for every `nw` of one `mw`. arg1 = B, 8 segments `waves*kc*4096` B by column (the V6 layout:
//!   segment `c` is the 64-column group `c` = B block `c/2`, half `c%2`), repeated for every `mw`. arg2 = C, 8
//!   column segments, each the shim S2MM0 stream (core rows 0,1: `(wave, rho%2)` tiles) followed by the S2MM1
//!   stream (core rows 2,3); a tile is `(mb 0..16, nb 0..8)` 8x8 blocks of little-endian i32 (`Epilogue::I32`,
//!   32 KiB) or int8 (`Epilogue::Int8`, 8 KiB; saturated `clamp(floor(c / 2^shift), -128, 127)`).
//!   [`ArrayDesign::unpack_out`] sign extends the int8 tiles; [`ArrayDesign::reference`] is the CPU result
//!   with the epilogue applied ([`apply_epilogue`]).
//! * Switch circuits (all circuit-switched, no master has two slaves; lanes are kept through every tile):
//!   - shim: `Mm2s0` (B half) -> `North0`, `Mm2s1` (A half) -> `North1` in all 8 columns; C returns on `North0`
//!     -> `S2mm0` (core rows 0,1) and `North1` -> `S2mm1` (core rows 2,3).
//!   - memtile: `South0 -> Dma4` (B S2MM), `South1 -> Dma5` (A S2MM), `Dma1 -> North4` (B), `Dma2 -> North5` (A),
//!     `North(r) -> Dma(r)` (C of core row r), and two C channels: `Dma0 -> South0` (rows 0,1), `Dma3 -> South1`
//!     (rows 2,3).
//!   - A: column `c` injects on `North5` up its column to core row `rho = c/2`, where `South5` feeds that core's
//!     `Dma0` and broadcasts along the row on horizontal lane `par = c%2` (`East(par)` / `West(par)`); in row
//!     `rho` the lane-`par` stream is taken into `Dma0` by every column `x` with `x%2 == par` and passed through
//!     by the others (tile `(x, rho)` selects `South5` if `x == 2*rho + par`, else `East(par)` for smaller `x`,
//!     `West(par)` for larger `x`). Rows below `rho` pass `South5 -> North5`.
//!   - B: column `c = 2j + h` injects B block `j` half `h` on `North4`; its rows `h` and `h+2` take it into `Dma1`
//!     (`North4` is passed up to row `h+2`). At row `h` it also crosses on horizontal lane 2 (`East2` if `h=0`,
//!     `West2` if `h=1`) into the neighbour column `2j + (1-h)`, which takes it at row `h` into `Dma1` and up
//!     lane 3 (`North3` at row `h`, `South3 -> North3` at row `h+1`, `South3 -> Dma1` at row `h+2`).
//!   - C: core `Dma0 -> South(rho)` down the column (as V6) into memtile S2MM `rho`.
//! * Memtile (offsets as V6): A ping 0 / pong 0x2000 (4 KiB used), B ping 0x4000 / pong 0x5000, C
//!   `0x6000 + slot*0x20000 + row*0x8000` (2 slots; an int8 row buffer is 8 KiB of that 32 KiB stride). Channel / BD
//!   banks (even channel BD<24, odd >=24): S2MM0..3 C rows {0,1}/{24,25}/{2,3}/{26,27}, S2MM4 B {4,5}, S2MM5 A {28,29};
//!   MM2S0 C rows 0,1 chain {6..9} (slot 0 rows 0,1, slot 1 rows 0,1), MM2S3 C rows 2,3 chain {32..35}, MM2S1 B {30,31},
//!   MM2S2 A {14,15}. 24 BDs per memtile.
//! * Shim (per column): BD0 B (arg1) on MM2S0, BD1 C stream 0 (arg2) on S2MM0, BD2 A half (arg0) on MM2S1,
//!   BD3 C stream 1 (arg2, `+ waves*2*tile` bytes) on S2MM1; both S2MM tasks issue a token (controller id set in
//!   both S2MM CTRL registers). The TXN waits for the tokens of both channels of all 8 columns: one aggregate SYNC per
//!   channel (`ncol = 8`). Submit / reset strategy is V6's (dynamic TXN, context reusable). The C drain of the
//!   core is overlapped with the next wave for `Epilogue::Int8` (separate `Cout` buffer) and serialized for
//!   `Epilogue::I32`; see [`ArrayDesign::estimate`] (V8 model: [`gemm_core::PAIR_CHUNK_CYCLES`] per chunk).
//!
//! ## V9 data movement ([`Variant::V9`], [`design_v9`]): resident B, N-wave outer
//! V8 re-reads B from DDR for every wave (`waves*kc*4096` B per column) although B depends on `nw` only. V9 keeps the
//! B tile of one N-wave (`kc*4096` B per column) resident in the memtile and replays it to the cores for all `MW`
//! M-waves of that `nw`; waves therefore run N-wave outer: `w = nw*MW + mw` (`Geometry::wave_coords`). The core
//! programs, core BDs/locks, switch circuits, shim channel assignment and C layout per wave are exactly V8's
//! (`Epilogue::Int8` only, the epilogue the C buffers below are sized for); only the memtile and the host layout change.
//! * Host layout: arg0 = A as V8 but in wave order (per injecting column `(wave, chunk, 4096 B)`, `waves*kc*4096` B);
//!   arg1 = B, per column one segment of `NW*kc*4096` B, `(nw, chunk, (kb, nb) blocks)`, each B tile **once**; arg2 = C as
//!   V8 (two streams of `waves*2*COUT_BYTES` per column) indexed by the wave number `w`. DDR read per submit is
//!   `8*4096*kc*(MW*NW + NW)` B (A `MW*NW`, B `NW` tiles per column) against V8's `8*4096*kc*2*MW*NW`.
//! * Limits: `MW <= 16` (one replay BD per `mw`, 16 free odd-bank BD ids), `NW <= 8`, `kc <= 54` i.e. `K <= 3456`
//!   (memory, below); `Epilogue::Int8` only.
//! * Memtile memory (bytes): A ping 0 / pong 0x2000; C compact `0x4000 + slot*0x8000 + row*0x2000` (8 KiB int8 tile
//!   per row, two slots x four rows = 64 KiB, ends at 0x14000); B `0x14000 + slot*kc*4096` (two slots). The last byte
//!   is `0x14000 + 2*kc*4096 <= 0x80000`, hence `kc <= (0x80000-0x14000)/(2*4096) = 54`. All replay/fill lengths are
//!   `kc*1024` words (<= 55296 < 2^17), one full B slot per BD.
//! * BDs (memtile; even channel BD < 24, odd >= 24): B producer S2MM4 two cyclic BDs 4 / 5, slot 0 / slot 1, each acquiring
//!   `B_EMPTY[0]` (-1) and releasing `B_FULL[0]` (+1). B replay MM2S1: a cyclic chain of `MW` BDs with ids from
//!   `[25, 27, 30, 31, 36..=47]` (the odd-bank ids not used by C producers 24/26, A producer 28/29 and C drain
//!   32..35), first id 25. Every replay BD reads slot 0 with an iteration `step = kc*1024` words (one slot stride /4),
//!   `wrap = 2`, `current = 0`: each time a BD is loaded the hardware advances `current`, so the slot toggles once per
//!   traversal of the whole chain (all BDs advance in lockstep). The first BD acquires `B_FULL[0]` (-1) only, the
//!   last releases `B_EMPTY[0]` (+1) only, the others have no lock action; with `MW = 1` the single BD does both.
//!   C producers: S2MM0/2 (rows 0, 2) keep V8's two-BD rings with distinct slot locks; S2MM1/3 (rows 1, 3) use one BD
//!   (ids 24 / 26) at slot 0 with iteration `step = 0x8000/4`, `wrap = 2`, `next = self` and the row-pair lock
//!   `c_lock(0, row)` (empty, full = empty+1). Their drains (MM2S0 BDs 6..9, MM2S3 BDs 32..35, slot 0 rows `2g,2g+1`
//!   then slot 1) use that same pair for both slots. A rings, core BDs and the A / C drain channels are V8's.
//! * Locks (memtile, initial): `B_EMPTY[0] = 2`, `B_FULL[0] = 0` (slot 1 pair unused/omitted); rows 1, 3
//!   `c_lock(0, row)` empty 2, full 0; rows 0, 2 per-slot pairs empty 1, full 0; A pairs empty 1, full 0.
//! * Ordered-semaphore argument: fill `j` goes to slot `j%2`, replay traversal `t` reads slot `t%2`; fills and
//!   traversals each complete in strict order (one channel each, in-order BD chains). `B_FULL` equals fills completed
//!   minus traversals started, so traversal `t` starts only when fills `0..=t` are complete; `B_EMPTY` equals
//!   `2 - fills started + traversals completed`, so fill `j` starts only when traversal `j-2` (the previous reader
//!   of the same slot) has completed (its last BD, which released `B_EMPTY`, has finished reading). The initial
//!   empty of 2 allows both slots to be prefilled. The same argument covers the single-BD C rows: a shared
//!   empty/full pair is correct because producer slots and drain slots both alternate strictly.
//! * Iteration reset: the iteration `current` lives in the BD word 6 and advances at every BD load; a DMA channel
//!   reset does not clear it. Every dynamic TXN therefore rewrites **all** resident memtile descriptors after the
//!   channel reset and before any queue is written, and the CDO carries the same descriptors. The shim channels
//!   are V8's (B: one BD of `NW*kc*4096` B).
//!
//! ## V10 data movement ([`Variant::V10`], [`design_v10`]): resident A and B, M-wave outer
//! V9 still reads A from DDR once per wave (`MW*NW` A tiles per column). V10 keeps **both** operands resident: each A tile
//! (`kc*4096` B per injecting column, depends on `mw` only) and the whole B segment of the column (`NW*kc*4096` B, one
//! tile per `nw`) are fetched from DDR exactly once per submit. Waves run in V8's order `w = mw*NW + nw`
//! (`Geometry::wave_coords`): for one `mw` the cores see the same A tile `NW` times and the B tiles `nw = 0..NW` in order.
//! Core programs, core BDs/locks, switch circuits, shim channels and the per-wave C layout are V8's / V9's
//! (`Epilogue::Int8` only); the distinct topology mode (`ResidentMode::MwOuter`) changes only the memtile and the host layout,
//! V8 / V9 descriptors, layouts and wave order are unchanged.
//! * Host layout: arg0 = A, per injecting column `(mw, chunk, 4096 B)`, `MW*kc*4096` B per column (`8*MW*kc*4096` total);
//!   arg1 = B, per column `(nw, chunk, (kb, nb) blocks)`, `NW*kc*4096` B (`8*NW*kc*4096` total), each B tile once; arg2 = C as V8
//!   (two streams of `waves*2*COUT_BYTES` per column) indexed by `w = mw*NW + nw`. DDR read per submit (model, bytes):
//!   `8*4096*kc*(MW + NW)` against V9's `8*4096*kc*(MW*NW + NW)` and V8's `8*4096*kc*2*MW*NW`.
//! * Limits: `Epilogue::Int8` only, `MW <= 16`, `NW <= 8` (as V9) and the memory bound `kc*(2 + NW) <= 112`
//!   (`V10_MAX_SLOTS`, below). `K <= 3456` (`kc <= 54`) is not a V10 limit by itself, e.g. `NW = 5` allows `kc <= 16`
//!   (`K <= 1024`); `NW = 1` allows `kc <= 37`. Larger shapes are rejected by [`design_v10`] with an explanatory panic.
//! * Memtile memory (byte offsets): compact C `slot*0x8000 + row*0x2000` (as V9, base 0, two slots x four rows x 8 KiB,
//!   ends `0x10000`); A slot 0 `0x10000`, A slot 1 `0x10000 + kc*4096`; B `0x10000 + 2*kc*4096`, `NW*kc*4096` B.
//!   The last byte is `0x10000 + (2 + NW)*kc*4096 <= 0x80000`, which is exactly `kc*(2 + NW) <= 112`. By the same bound
//!   the whole B segment is `NW*kc*1024 < 112*1024 = 114688` words, below the memtile BD maximum of 131071 words, so one BD
//!   always covers it (the A slot BDs are `kc*1024 <= 37*1024` words).
//! * BDs (memtile; even channel BD < 24, odd >= 24): B fill S2MM4: **one finite BD 4** (no `next`) of `NW*kc*1024` words,
//!   no acquire, release `B_FULL[0]` by `+MW` when the whole segment has landed. B replay MM2S1: **one cyclic BD 30**
//!   (`next = 30`) of the same `NW*kc*1024` words, acquire `B_FULL[0]` (-1), no release: one pass streams `nw = 0..NW` in
//!   core wave order and the lock holds exactly `MW` credits, so the channel makes exactly `MW` passes (the `MW` limit
//!   fits the signed 7-bit release value). A fill S2MM5: ring BDs 28 / 29 (slot 0 / 1) of `kc*1024` words each, acquire
//!   `A_EMPTY[0]` (-1), release `A_FULL[0]` (+1). A replay MM2S2: a cyclic chain of `NW` BDs 14..14+NW (even bank), every BD
//!   reads one full slot (`kc*1024` words) starting at slot 0 with iteration `step = kc*1024` words, `wrap = 2`,
//!   `current = 0`, so the slot toggles once per chain traversal (all BDs advance in lockstep, one load each); the first
//!   BD acquires `A_FULL[0]` (-1), the last releases `A_EMPTY[0]` (+1) (one BD: both). C producers (S2MM0..3: rings 0/1,
//!   2/3 and single iteration BDs 24, 26 with the row-pair lock) and C drains (MM2S0 BDs 6..9, MM2S3 BDs 32..35) are V9's
//!   descriptors with base 0.
//! * Locks (memtile, initial): `A_EMPTY[0] = 2`, `A_FULL[0] = 0`, `B_FULL[0] = 0` (B empty and the slot-1 A pair are
//!   unused); C locks as V9 (rows 1, 3 pair empty 2; rows 0, 2 per slot empty 1).
//! * Ordered-semaphore argument for A is V9's for B: fill `j` goes to slot `j%2`, traversal `t` reads slot `t%2`;
//!   `A_FULL` = fills completed - traversals started, `A_EMPTY` = 2 - fills started + traversals completed. A traversal is
//!   `NW` consecutive BDs of one chain that read the same slot without further synchronisation: the slot is only released
//!   after the last BD finished reading it, so the fill two steps later cannot overwrite it. B is written once before the
//!   first pass and read-only afterwards.
//! * DDR / shim: shim B BD 0 is one BD of `NW*kc*4096` B, shim A BD 2 one BD of `MW*kc*4096` B, both finite and read
//!   once; the A fill stalls the A lane when both slots are full, B and C use other lanes. B replay starts only after the
//!   whole B segment is resident, so the first core wave cannot begin before the B fill completed (modelled startup in
//!   [`ArrayDesign::estimate`]).
//! * Reset: BD word 6 `current` of the A replay chain advances at every load and a channel reset does not clear it, and
//!   the finite fill BD 4 has no ring to restart; every dynamic TXN therefore rewrites **all** resident memtile
//!   descriptors after the channel reset and before any queue is written (`build_txn_dynamic`), the CDO carries the same
//!   descriptors. The persistent channels (incl. the cyclic B replay left blocked on `B_FULL` after its `MW` passes) are
//!   reset by the TXN at the next submit, which also re-initialises every memtile lock.
//!
//! ## Opt-in V10 B prefix ([`design_v10_prefix`])
//! Retained prefix: BD 4 / 5 fill and guarded BD 30 / 31 read the B segment chunk by chunk in groups of at most 64 chunks;
//! `B_FULL` is credited +1 per chunk by the fill and -1 per chunk by the guarded read, and above 63 chunks a `B_EMPTY`
//! credit window of 63 bounds the `B_FULL` count. After the guarded pass a lockfree whole-segment BD 36 replays B
//! `MW - 1` times, queued only when `MW > 1`, and every submit rewrites all of it. It changes only the memtile
//! descriptors, the memtile locks and the queued memtile tasks of a resident design; core programs, core BDs / locks, shim
//! BDs, switch circuits, host layouts, wave order and `Program::finish` are unchanged. `design_v10` (`b_prefix: false`)
//! emits exactly the descriptors, locks and tasks described above. CDO and TXN take the same descriptors
//! (`memtile_descriptors`), locks (`memtile_locks`) and tasks (`ring_tasks`); the TXN rewrites every descriptor after the
//! channel reset, so a resubmit never depends on iteration `current`, a stopped finite BD or a lock left by the last run.
//! * V10 B prefix: the B fill / first replay pass is chunk granular instead of one whole-segment BD, so the first wave
//!   starts when the first B chunk landed. The segment has `T = NW*kc` chunks (`T <= 88` under `kc*(2 + NW) <= 112`; the
//!   code accepts `T <= 128`) of `1024` words each, split into groups of at most 64 chunks (DMA iteration wrap limit). Group
//!   `g` (first chunk `f`, length `L`, `g = 0, 1`): finite producer BD `4 + g` (S2MM4) and finite guarded reader BD
//!   `30 + g` (MM2S1), each `1024` words at `B + f*4096`, iteration `step = 1024`, `wrap = L`, `current = 0`, no `next`;
//!   queued tasks `repeat = L`, group order, producer 1..=2 tasks. Producer releases `B_FULL[0]` (+1) per chunk, reader
//!   acquires `B_FULL[0]` (-1), so the reader can only read landed chunks. Then one lockfree finite BD 36 of `T*1024` words
//!   (< 131072 by the memory bound) is queued with `repeat = MW - 1` only when `MW > 1`; it follows the guarded tasks in the same
//!   channel queue so it starts after the last chunk was read, B is immutable afterwards and needs no
//!   lock. Queue depth: AIE2P memtile `StartQSizeMax = 4`, `MaxRepeatCount = 256`
//!   (`ref/aie-rt/driver/src/global/xaie2pgbl_reginit.c`); at most 2 S2MM and 3 MM2S tasks are queued, asserted at design time
//!   (`groups + (MW > 1) <= 4`) because the simulator queue is unbounded.
//!   A lock holds at most 63, so for `T > 63` only: `B_EMPTY[0] = 63` initially, the producer acquires it (-1) and the
//!   guarded reader releases it (+1), bounding `B_FULL` credits to 63. For `T <= 63` the producer has no acquire and the reader
//!   no release. A and C are V10's. `used_channels` deduplicates channels that carry more than one queued task, the reset
//!   order is unchanged.
//!
//! ## G80 ([`Variant::G80`], [`gemm_g80`]): 128x80 core tile, N = 1280 exact
//! Vertical-pair A sharing as V8 on the 128x80 core of [`gemm_core_g80`]: a wave is 256 rows x 1280 columns (core row `r`
//! of column `c` computes M tile `r/2`, N tile `2c + r%2` of 80 columns); only columns 0..4 inject A. This file only
//! dispatches (`Kind::G80`): circuits, memtile BDs / locks / queued tasks, host packing and the estimate live in
//! `gemm_g80`; CDO, TXN, shim BDs and the `emit_dynamic_body` reset / requeue sequence are shared with V8..V10, and every
//! submit rewrites all G80 memtile BDs after the channel reset.
//!
//! ## IEF15 ([`Variant::Ief15`], [`iu4_ief15`]): 64x32 core tile, 256 x 256 wave
//! The V8 pair structure unchanged (circuits [`pair_column_circuits`], memtile map, BD ids, locks, tasks, lean parity plan with
//! `J = epochs * waves`, `W = waves`) on the [`iu4_ief15_core`] tile: one A half / B chunk of 2176 B per K128 epoch (`Kind::Ief15`
//! with `kc = epochs`), f32 `Cout` tile of 8192 B (the V8 int8 `COUT_BYTES`, so `pair_c_offset` is unchanged). Only the ring BD
//! lengths (`iu4_ief15::memtile_descriptors`), the core BDs (`iu4_ief15_core::tile_bds`), the host segment sizes and the core
//! programs differ; packing, unpacking and the reference are `iu4_ief15`'s, `Geometry::pack_a` / `pack_b` / `unpack_c` reject it.
//!
//! ## Submit / context reuse strategy
//! The PDI (CDO) only loads state that survives a run: core program memory, all tile/memtile BDs, switch
//! routes, shim NOC mux and token route. It does NOT enqueue any task, initialize any lock, or enable a core.
//! Every submit (TXN) starts from the same state, so a context can be resubmitted any number of times,
//! including odd `kc*waves` (where the A/B ping-pong rings would otherwise stop on the pong slot):
//! 1. halt + reset every core (`CORE_CONTROL` mask 3 <- reset);
//! 2. assert then deassert reset (CTRL bit1, ref/aie-rt `xaie2pgbl_params.h`) on every compute-tile and
//!    memtile persistent-ring channel - this clears queued BDs, the active BD and the ring position, so rings
//!    restart at ping / slot 0 / BD6. Shim channels are NOT reset (aie-rt rejects shim reset; shim CTRL bit1 is
//!    pause-mem): shim queues are finite and have drained before the C token that ended the previous submit;
//! 3. initialize every core and memtile lock to its initial value (no DMA is active at this point);
//! 4. deassert core reset, `CORE_PC <- 0`;
//! 5. queue core and memtile rings (cyclic BD chains, repeat 1), enabling compute channels only (memtile
//!    queues start on enqueue); set the shim token controller id, rewrite finite BDs, DDR-patch and queue;
//! 6. enable all cores last, then wait for the C token of all 8 shim S2MM0 channels.
//! Assumes the previous submit completed (its sync returned), so nothing is in flight in the switches.
//!
//! ## Deviations from the vendor whole-array design (`032eb944...`), see also module header
//! * The vendor streams full-K operands with multi-dimensional BDs and `ObjectFifo` repeat; here every L3/L2
//!   transfer is a plain contiguous 1-D BD and the host pre-packs A/B ([`ArrayDesign::pack_in`]) into the exact
//!   order the cores consume, so the shim reads each byte exactly once per use and the cores stream K in
//!   64-element chunk buffers (contract local buffers: A 8 KiB x2, B 4 KiB x2, C resident 32 KiB).
//! * Routes are regular (same B/C lanes in every column, A on a dedicated lane 5 and per-row East/West
//!   broadcast) rather than the vendor's placement-driven port assignment.
//! * The persistent rings are not started from the CDO; every submit restarts them from the TXN so a context
//!   can be resubmitted regardless of the parity of `kc*waves`.
//! * The existing `dma::vendor_gate` and route structural oracle gates validate the BD/task and switch
//!   encoders against the vendor artifacts; they do not assert equality of this changed deployment.
//!
//! ## Hardware bisect variants ([`Variant`], [`design_variant`])
//! Hardware run 1 of the whole-array deployment (V6) timed out; the variants narrow it down. All use the same
//! core program, the same three arguments (A, B, C) and the same `pack_in`/`unpack_out` API; the wave is the
//! variant's own tile set (`rows*128 x cols*64`), M/N are padded to it, and `output_tile_ranges` reports the
//! packed-C byte ranges written by each active physical tile.
//!
//! | variant | shape | active tiles | data movement | configuration |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | V1 | 128x64 | core (0,2) | shim <-> memtile switch pass-through <-> core, same lane through the memtile (AIE2P North/South pass-through must keep the lane): B `South0->North0->South0->Dma1`, A `South1->North1->South1->Dma0`, C `Dma0->South0->North0->shim` | static CDO, shim-only TXN |
//! | V2 | 128x64 | core (0,2) | as the array but 1 row/1 column: memtile DMA rings for A, B, C (2 C slots, 2-BD C drain chain) | static |
//! | V3 | 512x64 | column 0, rows 2..5 | one memtile, no helper columns (below) | static |
//! | V4 | 128x512 | row 2, columns 0..7 | array routes restricted to row 0: A injected by column 0 and broadcast East, B per column, 2-BD C drain chain | static |
//! | V5 | 512x512 | full 8x4 | as V6 | static CDO, shim-only TXN |
//! | V6 | 512x512 | full 8x4 | as designed above | dynamic TXN (resets + requeues), one aggregate SYNC |
//! | V6b | 512x512 | full 8x4 | as V6 | dynamic TXN, 8 separate SYNCs |
//! | V8 | 512x512 | full 8x4 | V8 data movement (above), not in [`Variant::ALL`] | dynamic TXN, 2 aggregate SYNCs, `design_v8` |
//! | V9 | 512x512 | full 8x4 | V9 data movement (above): resident B, N-wave outer, not in [`Variant::ALL`] | dynamic TXN, 2 aggregate SYNCs, `design_v9` |
//! | V10 | 512x512 | full 8x4 | V10 data movement (above): resident A and B, M-wave outer, not in [`Variant::ALL`] | dynamic TXN, 2 aggregate SYNCs, `design_v10` |
//! | G80 | 256x1280 | full 8x4 | G80 data movement ([`gemm_g80`], N = 1280, `K <= 2560`), not in [`Variant::ALL`] | dynamic TXN, 2 aggregate SYNCs, `gemm_g80::design_g80` |
//!
//! *Static* (V1..V5): the CDO additionally loads core/memtile locks, queues and enables every core and memtile
//! ring, releases core reset, sets PC 0 and enables the cores last (as `gemm_i8::design` does); the TXN only
//! has the shim token controller id, shim BDs + DDR patches, shim tasks and one `SYNC(col, ncol=1, nrow=1)`
//! per active column (V6: one `SYNC(0, ncol=8)`). Static designs are valid for a fresh context only (a second
//! submit would find drained, non-restarted rings).
//!
//! V3 one-column layout (36 memtile BDs, 36 locks, 328 KiB): shim MM2S0 streams A interleaved as
//! `(wave, chunk, core row 0..3)` into memtile S2MM4, an 8-BD producer chain (slot 0 rows 0..3, slot 1 rows
//! 0..3, A at `slot*0x8000 + row*0x2000`, locks `slot*8+row*2`); memtile MM2S0..3 are the per-row A consumers
//! (2-BD rings) onto switch lanes `North(row)`, which core tiles pass up `South(r) -> North(r)` until row `r`
//! (`South(r) -> Dma0`). Shim MM2S1 streams B into S2MM5 (ping `0x10000`/pong `0x11000`, locks 16..19), MM2S4
//! broadcasts it on `North4` up the column. Core row `r` C returns on lane `South(r)` into S2MM r (C at
//! `0x12000 + slot*0x20000 + row*0x8000`, locks `20 + slot*8 + row*2`); MM2S5 joins slot 0 rows 0..3, slot 1
//! rows 0..3 (8-BD chain) onto `South0` to shim S2MM0. DMA ports are duplex (A out `Dma(r)` vs C in `Dma(r)`,
//! A in `Dma4` vs B out `Dma4`, B in `Dma5` vs C join `Dma5`). BDs: even channels `0..8` A producer (ch4),
//! `8/9` C row 0, `10/11` C row 2, `12/13` A row 0, `14/15` A row 2, `16/17` B consumer (ch4); odd channels
//! `24/25` B producer (ch5), `26/27` C row 1, `28/29` C row 3, `30/31` A row 1, `32/33` A row 3, `34..41` C join.
//! The V3 A stream is one argument segment (not four row segments): `pack_in` interleaves chunk then row.
//!
//! ## Core program variants ([`CoreVariant`], [`design_variant_core`])
//! Second hardware bisect: on hardware every [`Variant`] timed out with the compute cores finished (`CoreDone`)
//! but the C-full lock never released. [`design_variant_core`] swaps only the program loaded into the active cores
//! ([`gemm_core::program_variant`]); DMA rings, locks, switches, host layouts, the CDO/TXN structure and
//! [`ArrayDesign::output_tile_ranges`] are those of the [`Variant`]. [`design_variant`] / [`design`] always use
//! [`CoreVariant::Fast`] (the default program).
//! * `Fast`: the default optimized program, exact GEMM.
//! * `Serial`: exact GEMM (identical C to `Fast`) with a serialized program; [`ArrayDesign::unpack_out`] applies.
//! * `LockOnly`: no multiply. Per physical tile and wave it acquires/releases every A/B chunk and then the full C
//!   buffer, and fills the first 64 little-endian `i32` words of that tile's packed C frame (the range reported by
//!   [`ArrayDesign::output_tile_ranges`]) with `0xC0DE0000 + wave*0x100 + word`, where `wave` is the zero-based
//!   wave of the design. The remaining words of the frame are unspecified. The output is NOT a GEMM, so
//!   `unpack_out` is meaningless; check the per-tile frame prefix instead.
