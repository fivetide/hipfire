//! Persistent-ring command streams: one TXN that runs `S` GEMMs, each gated on a ring slot sequence number
//! published by the host / GPU and acknowledged by a DONE line written by the NPU.
//!
//! The protocol (ring BO layout, seq / slot numbering, producer rule) is frozen in the shared spec
//! (`railgun-spec.md`, "Persistent ring protocol"); this module encodes the NPU side for the V9 design
//! ([`gemm_array::design_v9`], `Epilogue::Int8 { shift: 12 }`, `Control::Fast`).
//!
//! # Arguments
//! `args = [A arena (In), B arena (In), C arena (Out), ring (In)]`: arg 3 is the ring BO of
//! [`RingLayout::bytes`] bytes (it is read AND written by the NPU, but `ArgKind::Out` would make a harness overwrite
//! the header, hence `In`). `SlotPlan::{a_off, b_off, c_off}` are byte offsets into args 0 / 1 / 2: every shim DDR patch
//! of run `i` is the vendor patch (`column offset`) plus the run's arena offset. Arena sizes are `max offset + one
//! run's packed bytes`.
//!
//! # Per-run command stream
//! ```text
//! prologue (once)   reset+release memtile(0) S2MM4 and MM2S0; shim(0) S2MM0 token controller id;
//!                   memtile BD Q (self loop, 1 word -> X); memtile BD DQ (16 words <- Y);
//!                   shim BD SENT (1 word <- ring sentinel, DDR patched); shim BD D (16 words, patched per run)
//! run i:  POLL      reset+release memtile S2MM4; WRITE32 X := 0 (never a seq: a stale seq or sentinel left by an earlier
//!                   run/submission can never satisfy the poll); shim BD P (1 word <- ring slot line, DDR patched, next = P) queued on
//!                   shim MM2S0, memtile BD Q queued on S2MM4: the shim re-reads the slot seq word from DDR forever and the
//!                   memtile re-stores it into X. MASKPOLL X == seq(i)                              <- PollSeq(i) site
//!         DRAIN     WRITE32 shim BD P tail word: next = SENT. The loop finishes its current iteration, then SENT reads the
//!                   sentinel word 0xFFFF_FFFF (never a seq) and ends, so MASKPOLL X == SENTINEL proves the last word
//!                   the shim will ever send for this poll has landed in X (stream order); nothing stray can reach the
//!                   B producer queued by the body.
//!         BODY      (GEMM runs) vendor V9 reset+restart body, shim patches advanced by the slot arena offsets, ends with
//!                   the two aggregate C SYNCs. [`persistent_v9_lean`] runs `1..` use the lean body instead (below).
//!         DONE      reset+release memtile MM2S0 (strictly after the C SYNC: every C word has reached DDR, so the stalled
//!                   cyclic C drain chain is no longer needed); 16 WRITE32 build the done line at Y
//!                   (`done_seq` <- DoneSeq(i) site, slot, 'DONE', 0..); shim S2MM0 BD D (token) and memtile MM2S0 BD DQ
//!                   move it as one 64-byte DMA write to the ring done line; SYNC(shim 0 S2MM0).
//! ```
//! `Neg::SkipDone(i)` omits the whole DONE block of run `i` (and its `DoneSeq(i)` patch site).
//!
//! Channel reuse (approved P1 deviation, vendor CTRL registers only): after a V9 run memtile S2MM4 (B producer ring)
//! and MM2S0 (C drain chain) stay active but stalled on locks, so the spare tasks above could never run. They are reset
//! and released (CTRL bit 1, the same register the body uses) before every POLL (S2MM4) and every DONE (MM2S0).
//! The body resets them again at its start, which also kills the leftover self-loop Q.
//!
//! # Latch argument for the single-word tail flip
//! DMA descriptor registers are latched when a BD is loaded (channel start or chain follow), never re-read mid-BD
//! (the simulator models exactly this: `Engine::step` decodes the BD registers only when `current` is empty). P is a
//! single BD whose `next` is itself, so every iteration is a fresh load of P's eight registers. The flip changes ONE
//! register, tail word 7 (`next` P -> SENT; P has no locks, so no other field of that word changes), by ONE 32-bit
//! register write; every other P word is identical before and after. Hence a load sees either the old BD (`next = P`,
//! one more seq-line read) or the new BD (`next = SENT`) and never a mixed state, and the iteration that loaded the new
//! tail is the last one of P. A load that happened before the write keeps its latched `next = P` and so costs exactly one
//! more P iteration, which still reads the slot seq line, never the sentinel. SENT is finite and is the only BD that reads
//! the sentinel, so X can only become SENTINEL after the last word the shim sends: X == SENTINEL implies every earlier
//! word is already in X (single in-order stream, memtile Q stores them in arrival order) and none follows. That the
//! hardware latches the same way is an assumption of the NPU's BD model (aie-rt BD semantics), checked only in the
//! simulator.
//!
//! # Spare ids (derived, see `gemm_array::v9_spare_memtile_bds`, `PAIR_SHIM_BDS_USED`)
//! * shim BDs 0..4 are used by V9 (B, C0, A, C1); P = 4, SENT = 5, D = 6.
//! * memtile BD ids come from the V9 descriptors at the maximal topology (`mw 16, nw 8, kc 54`): even bank used
//!   0..=9 and 14, 15, so the first two free even-bank ids are Q = 10 (S2MM4) and DQ = 11 (MM2S0). Both channels are
//!   even, hence BD < 24 (`Task::write` bank rule); the choice is independent of `mw`, `nw`, `kc`.
//!
//! # Scratch addresses (memtile column 0)
//! X = [`POLL_SCRATCH`] `0x1000` (one word) and Y = [`DONE_SCRATCH`] `0x3000` (64 bytes). The V9 A ring slots are
//! `0x0000` and `0x2000` but each BD moves only `A_HALF_BYTES = 4096` B, so `0x1000..0x2000` and `0x3000..0x4000` are
//! never accessed by any V9 memtile DMA for any `kc`/`mw`/`nw` (the compact C buffers start at `0x4000`, B slots at
//! `0x14000`; cores never address memtile memory). They are therefore dead between GEMMs AND during them: no run
//! can clobber the poll word or the staged done line, and the scratch writes cannot corrupt operands. The unit test
//! `scratch_is_outside_v9_footprint` checks this against the real descriptors. (V10 puts C at `0` and would collide;
//! the ring is V9 only.)
//!
//! # Lean bodies ([`persistent_v9_lean`])
//! Contract: run 0 of every submission is the FULL vendor body (valid right after the PDI load and after any completed
//! submission); run `i >= 1` is `ArrayDesign::append_lean_run_body`, which assumes the array was left by a COMPLETED
//! run of the same design: previous body + DONE of the same submission (its DONE SYNC returned strictly after the C
//! SYNC) and then this run's POLL / DRAIN. POLL / DONE clobber exactly two memtile column-0 channels the lean plan
//! believes are parked at their first BD: S2MM4 (reset, then left running the self-loop Q that stalls for stream data)
//! and MM2S0 (reset, one 64-byte DQ transfer, idle). They are passed as forced repairs
//! (`ArrayDesign::lean_insts_requeue` semantics): CTRL reset + release, the `B_EMPTY[0]` credit lock rewritten to its
//! initial value (S2MM4 only; the reset dropped a lookahead credit the hardware may or may not have taken), and requeue
//! at BD 4 / BD 6. A channel the shape's own parity plan already resets (S2MM4 for odd `NW`, MM2S0 for odd `waves`)
//! is deduplicated and keeps the plan's repair, so forced ops are only emitted where they are needed. MM2S0 has no
//! credit lock and no iteration `current` (FULL locks are unacquired when parked). The result is a state equal to
//! the canonical start state of the full body, so the end state after every run is identical to a full ring
//! (`Config::state_snapshot`). Other channels are not touched by POLL / DONE (Q / DQ / X / Y use spare BDs and dead
//! memtile bytes); shim BDs P / SENT / D are disjoint from the four shim BDs the body rewrites. `Neg::SkipLeanRequeue(i)`
//! drops the forced ops of lean run `i` only. The patch inventory is unchanged: poll `PollSeq(i)` + `DoneSeq(i)` per
//! run, exactly 2 sites per run for every run, lean or full.
//!
//! Bytes: every op is a fixed number of u32 words (`write32` 24 B, `mask_write` / `mask_poll` 28 B, shim / memtile
//! `block_write` 48 B, `ddr_patch` 48 B, `sync` 16 B). Lean bytes/run = 856 (POLL + DRAIN 304, DONE 552) + lean body,
//! with lean body = 7,776 (32 cores x (halt 28 + release 28 + PC 24 + enable 28), shim 8 x 536, SYNC 32)
//! + per-parity repairs, per column unless stated: odd `kc*waves` 8,448 (cores) + 184 x 8; odd `NW` 8 x (184 + 28 `MW`);
//! odd `waves` 8 x 576; forced S2MM4 (NW even) 104 and MM2S0 (waves even) 80 at column 0 only. The same model gives the
//! measured lean sizes 7,792 B and 11,056 B (header 16 B) and the measured 856 B protocol-only run.
//!
//! # Patch inventory
//! Exactly the value word of each poll MASKPOLL (`PollSeq(i)`) and of the done-seq WRITE32 (`DoneSeq(i)`), both
//! u32 word indices counted from the first byte of `insts` (header included). Run `i` of a submission starting at
//! `seq0` uses `seq0 + i`. 2 sites per run, 1 for a `SkipDone` run's poll only. Everything else, including the slot index,
//! offsets and ring lines, is fixed by the build.
//!
//! # Instruction footprint
//! Each submission has a 396-byte header/prologue plus the following bytes per run (16 sequence patch words for S=8):
//! | V9 shape | Bytes/run | Bytes, S=8 |
//! | --- | ---: | ---: |
//! | 512x512x64 | 49,208 | 394,060 |
//! | 4096x1280x2560 | 51,896 | 415,564 |
//! | 4096x2560x640 | 51,896 | 415,564 |
//! | Empty echo | 856 | 7,244 |
//! These are measured encoder lengths, not hardware latency measurements. Slot offsets do not affect encoded length.
//!
//! [`persistent_v9_lean`] keeps run 0 (full) and replaces runs `1..` by the lean body plus the forced col-0 repairs
//! (see "Lean bodies" for the byte method, which reproduces the two measured lean TXN sizes of the lean module,
//! 7,792 B and 11,056 B). "Measured" rows are encoder lengths of the built `insts` (`S=8`, run 0 full, 7 lean);
//! "derived" rows come from the op-size model only:
//! | V9 shape | Lean bytes/run | Bytes, S=8 lean | Bytes, S=8 full | Source |
//! | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
//! | 512x512x64 | 24,856 | 223,596 | 394,060 | derived (full row measured above) |
//! | 4096x1280x2560 | 11,976 | 136,124 | 415,564 | measured |
//! | 4096x2560x640 | 11,976 | 136,124 | 415,564 | measured |
//! | 512x512x128 | 14,936 | 154,156 | 394,060 | measured |
//! | 1024x512x128 | 10,632 | 396 + full + 7 x 10,632 | | derived |
//! | 512x1024x128 (all parities even) | 8,816 | 396 + full + 7 x 8,816 | | derived |
//! The 16 sequence patch words of S=8 are unchanged (2 per run); `patch_seq` output equals a fresh build.
