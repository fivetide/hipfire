//! Lean persistent submit of the V8 / V9 / V10 / G80 pair designs: the dynamic TXN of [`ArrayDesign`] (`emit_dynamic_body`)
//! minus every reset / lock / descriptor write whose target already holds the right value after a completed submit.
//!
//! # Contract
//! `ArrayDesign::lean_insts` is valid **only** for a submit that directly follows a *completed* submit (its C-token
//! SYNCs returned and the array quiesced) of the same context (same PDI, same design), made with either
//! [`ArrayDesign::insts`] or a previous lean TXN. The first submit after the PDI is loaded MUST use the full
//! `insts` (the PDI initialises no lock, queues no task and enables no core, and the cores / DMA channels are not
//! yet in the post-run state derived below). Both flavours produce byte-identical outputs and leave the array in the
//! same state (every `Config::state_snapshot` field), so any mix of full and lean submits is valid.
//!
//! # Method
//! A full submit initialises the *canonical start state* `S0` (cores reset, channels reset and requeued at their
//! first BD, resident descriptors rewritten, every lock at its initial value, cores enabled). The lean TXN needs
//! `S0` as well, but starts from the end state `S_end` of the previous run. Both runs execute the same
//! deterministic schedule, so `S_end` is derived analytically from per-channel counts of completed BD loads and
//! compared with `S0`; an element is repaired only if `S_end != S0` **and** the difference is not erased by the
//! equivalence below. The prefix option additionally clears its finite iteration fields on every submit, explicitly
//! preserving the prefix descriptor contract even though each complete group wraps them back to zero.
//!
//! ## Equivalence used (parked channel == queued channel)
//! A channel whose ring ends *at its first BD* (`BD index == start`) is parked there: either the descriptor is
//! latched and its lock not yet acquired (MM2S: acquire of a full lock that is never granted), or acquired with the
//! empty lock already decremented and waiting for stream data (S2MM "lookahead" acquire; a BD acquires its lock
//! before data arrives). That is exactly the state a freshly queued channel reaches after its first tick, so the
//! channel, its locks and its descriptor registers are left untouched. A channel parked at a *different* BD, or
//! whose latched descriptor carries a stale iteration `current`, cannot be used by the restarted cores / the
//! canonical schedule: it is reset (CTRL bit1 pulse, drops the engine and queue, NOT the BD registers), its locks
//! are overwritten with their initial values (this also returns a lookahead credit the reset dropped, whether or not
//! the hardware had taken it), the iteration `current` of its BDs is cleared if nonzero, and the task is requeued
//! (+ ENABLE on compute tiles, as the full TXN).
//!
//! ## Counts (per memtile / per core, `J = kc*waves` chunks, `W = waves`)
//! `lookahead(c)` = the load of BD `c mod len` after `c` completed loads; ring BD index `= c mod 2` (rings),
//! `c mod len` (chains).
//!
//! | element | completed loads | parked at | returns to start iff |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | core S2MM0 A ring {0,1}, S2MM1 B ring {2,3} (all designs) | `J` each | BD `J mod 2` (+ `A/B_EMPTY[J mod 2]` lookahead) | `J` even |
//! | core MM2S0 C, BD 4 self-cyclic | `W` | BD 4, `C_FULL` unacquired | always |

//! | V10 prefix guarded B replay MM2S1 BD `30+g` | `L_g` per finite task, `T` total | idle after guarded tasks (or after BD 36); each register `current = 0` | never: requeue groups in order, `repeat = L_g`; clear their currents |

//! | C drains MM2S0 {6..9}, MM2S3 {32..35} (two BDs per wave) | `2W` | BD `2W mod 4`, full locks unacquired | `W` even |
//!
//! Locks at the end: every `*_FULL` and `PEER_*` lock is 0 (each release is matched by exactly one acquire, the
//! pair protocol being symmetric), every `*_EMPTY` lock is initial except the single lookahead credit of each parked
//! S2MM channel, `C_EMPTY = 1`, `C_FULL = 0`. Hence the only *non-equivalent* lock differences arise on channels that
//! are reset, and those are overwritten with the initial value.
//! Prefix locks need no writes: fill releases `B_FULL[0]` exactly `T` times, guarded readers acquire it exactly `T`
//! times (`0 + T - T = 0`). Above 63 chunks only, fill acquires `B_EMPTY[0]` `T` times and guarded readers release it
//! `T` times (`63 - T + T = 63`); below that bound neither uses it. Finite tasks have no next-BD lookahead, so neither
//! prefix channel holds a dropped credit after completion. The last load of each group wraps its register current to 0
//! before that finite task completes; explicit current clears are idempotent, not a repair of a stale latch.
//!
//! ## G80 (`J = kc * mw`, `W = mw`)
//! The G80 memtile map, BDs, locks and finite tasks are those of `gemm_g80` (module documentation, "Completed-submit end
//! state"); the plan below only re-derives which of them differ from the canonical start `S0` after a completed submit.
//! * **A (columns 0..4)** is the V8 ring: `J` odd resets S2MM5 / MM2S2 to BD 28 / 14 and rewrites the pong `A_EMPTY[1]`
//!   (lock 2) to its initial 1. Columns 4..8 own no A channel and no A lock, so their A resets and lock writes are filtered
//!   out at emission (per column), never issued.
//! * **B** is entirely finite: fill BD 4 -> 5 (`repeat = kc`), guard BD 30 / 42 (`repeat = kc`), whole BD 31 / 43
//!   (`repeat = mw - 1`). After a completed submit every one of these channels is idle with an empty queue (no BD is loaded
//!   after the last repeat, so there is no lookahead credit and no parked BD), the iteration `current` of BD 4, 5, 30, 42 has
//!   wrapped to 0 (`kc` loads, `wrap = kc`), and the ready locks 4 / 6 are `kc - kc = 0` (fill releases `kc` times, the guard
//!   acquires `kc` times). Hence **no B channel reset and no B lock write is ever needed**, but every submit MUST requeue, in
//!   this order per channel: fill `repeat = kc`; guard 30 `repeat = kc` then whole 31 `repeat = mw - 1` (MM2S1); guard 42 then
//!   whole 43 (MM2S5). Whole tasks are omitted for `mw = 1`. The current of BD 4, 5, 30, 42 is cleared (mask bits 23..28)
//!   on every submit: idempotent after a completed run, required if a reset ever interrupted a guard / fill mid-iteration.
//!   The finite-queue shape (guard, whole) is the same for every `kc`, `mw` and J / W parity, so the lean state snapshot after
//!   changing operands or odd / even J / W equals the full submit's.
//! * **C** is the V8 non-shared pair: `W` odd resets S2MM0..3 and the drains MM2S0 / MM2S3 to BD `C_S2MM_BD[r][0]`, 6, 32 and
//!   returns the slot-1 empty lock `c_lock(1, r)` (initial 1). No shared pair C lock exists for G80, rows 1 and 3 included.
//! * **Cores**: as every design (`J` odd resets A / B rings and returns `A_EMPTY[1]`, `B_EMPTY[1]`); the core C ring is parked
//!   at BD 4 for any `W`; `C_EMPTY`, acquired before chunk 0 of each wave, is released back by the drain, so it is 1 at the end
//!   and needs no write.
//!
//! ## IEF15 (`J = epochs * waves` via `geo.kc = epochs`, `W = waves`)
//! The IEF15 memtile map, BD ids, locks and tasks are V8's streaming pair (`Topo` kind `Ief15` takes the V8 arms: no
//! iteration, no finite tasks), only the ring BD lengths differ, so the V8 ring parity plan applies unchanged: `J` odd
//! resets the memtile A / B rings and the core A / B rings and returns the pong `A_EMPTY` / `B_EMPTY` credits, `W` odd
//! repairs the C rings and drains.
//!
//! Prefix verification in `crates/pm-npu/tests/lean.rs` compares three changing-operand lean submits and full/lean
//! interleaves to both the CPU reference and a fresh full-TXN configuration, including every retained snapshot field.
//! It covers one/two groups and `MW = 1`/`MW > 1`, forced channel resets, and missing finite-task requeues.
//! For Fast int8 (`shift = 12`), V10 prefix down `4096x2560x640` is 8,816 B lean versus 49,136 B full;
//! the padded `160x2560x640` design is 15,824 B lean versus 48,944 B full.
//!
//! ## Why the cores always restart
//! A finished core is `DONE` (status bit, PC past the program); only a `CORE_CONTROL` reset clears it, and the core
//! program restarts its ping/pong phase `r4 = 0`. So every core gets halt+reset, release + `CORE_PC = 0` (same
//! sequence as the full TXN), and the enable last.
//!
//! ## Why shim and SYNC are always emitted
//! Shim BDs carry DDR-patched host addresses (the host may use new buffers per submit), the token controller id and
//! the finite tasks are consumed per run; they are emitted exactly as [`emit_shim`] does. SYNC is
//! [`emit_sync`]`(pair, per_column = false)`.
//!
//! ## Op order
//! 1. halt+reset of all 32 cores; 2. CTRL RESET assert then release on exactly the repaired channels;
//! 3. BD word 6 `current := 0` of exactly the iteration BDs listed above (mask bits 23..28);
//! 4. lock writes of exactly the dropped lookahead credits; 5. core reset release + `CORE_PC`;
//! 6. requeue (+ ENABLE on compute tiles) of exactly the reset channels, plus V10's completed finite B tasks (prefix:
//! fill groups then guarded groups then optional BD 36, using the full submit's task repeats);
//! 7. shim; 8. enable cores; 9. SYNC. A non-prefix design whose parities are all even therefore needs only 4 core ops per
//! core (+ V10's single fill requeue per column), the shim and the SYNC.
//!
//! The quiescence assumption (lookahead credits already taken at the C token) holds with a margin of thousands of
//! cycles: the credit of a channel is taken as soon as the consumer of its previous use released, which is before
//! the last C tile leaves the memtile; and every repair writes an absolute initial value, so a hardware that does not
//! take the lookahead is repaired equally.
//!
//! # Forced channel repair (`lean_insts_requeue`, `append_lean_run_body`)
//! The contract above also assumes nothing but the design's own run touched the array since the completed submit. The
//! persistent ring (`ring.rs`) inserts a POLL (memtile col 0 S2MM4 reset, then a self-looping 1-word task that stays
//! running) and a DONE (col 0 MM2S0 reset, one finite 16-word task) between two bodies, so S2MM4 and MM2S0 are no
//! longer "parked at their first BD" even when the shape's parity says so. The caller names such channels as
//! `(column, direction, channel)` and each one gets the reset path of the plan, regardless of parity:
//!
//! | forced channel | reset + requeue BD | credit lock rewritten to its initial value |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | memtile S2MM4 (V8 / V9 B fill) | BD 4 | `B_EMPTY[0]`: the BD-4 lookahead credit of the even-parity park (V9: shared lock, initial 2; V8: initial 1) |
//! | memtile S2MM4 (V10 finite fill) | BD 4 | none (no acquire); the completed requeue is promoted to reset + requeue |
//! | memtile S2MM4 (V10 prefix finite fill) | reset once, keep every BD `4+g` task in group order with `repeat = L_g` | none: completed finite tasks hold no lookahead credit, including above 63 chunks |
//! | memtile S2MM4 (G80 finite fill) | reset once; the plan's fill task `repeat = kc` is kept (not replaced by one repeat) | none: no acquire, ready locks 4 / 6 already 0 |
//! | memtile MM2S0 / MM2S3 (C drains) | BD 6 / BD 32 | none: FULL locks are acquired only on a grant, so a reset parks nothing |
//!
//! Equivalence: the lock write is absolute, so it restores the credit whether or not the reset dropped one (the same
//! argument as for odd-parity repairs, which use the lock of BD 5 because they park there); the BD registers of BD 4 / 6
//! are never rewritten by POLL / DONE (they use other BDs), so the requeue loads the unchanged canonical descriptor;
//! the reset also kills a still running self-loop task. A channel the plan already resets at this shape keeps the
//! plan's repair (parity lock, `current` clears): the forced entry is skipped, and a credit lock the plan already
//! rewrites is not written twice. Forced ops join steps 2 (reset), 4 (lock) and 6 (requeue) of the op order and add,
//! per forced channel, 56 B (reset + release) + 24 B (requeue, absent for V10 finite fills already requeued) + 24 B
//! (credit lock, V8/V9 S2MM4 only). Unsupported channels or columns return Err before any op is appended.
//! `lean_insts()` is `lean_insts_requeue(&[])`.
