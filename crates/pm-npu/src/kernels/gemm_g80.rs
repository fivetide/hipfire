//! G80 whole-array deployment ([`Variant::G80`](super::gemm_array::Variant::G80), [`design_g80`]): the vertical-pair A-sharing
//! V8 structure on the 128x80 core of [`gemm_core_g80`]. Nothing here is a hardware claim: every statement below is
//! what the encoders in this file emit; behaviour on silicon is not established.
//!
//! # Problem shape and wave
//! `N = 1280` exactly, `K = 64 * kc` with `kc` in `1..=40` (`K <= 2560`), `M >= 1` padded with zero rows to `256 * mw`;
//! `waves = mw` (there is one N wave) and `waves <= 256`. Core `(col c, core row r)` of wave `w` computes the 128x80
//! output tile with M block `r / 2` (rows `w*256 + (r/2)*128 ..+128`) and N tile `2c + r % 2` (columns
//! `(2c + r%2)*80 ..+80`). The two cores of a vertical pair (core rows `2q`, `2q+1`) share one 128-row A block through
//! neighbour data memory (`PairRole::Lower` row `2q` receives the even-`mb` half, `Upper` row `2q+1` the odd half; the
//! peer lock protocol and the reverse int8 epilogue are [`gemm_core_g80`]'s). `Epilogue::Int8` only; `Control` may be
//! `Fast`, `Slow` or a `Probe` with `layout == 0` (`nocompute` and `repeat=N` are timing-only: the host packing, the
//! DMA protocol and every byte count below are unchanged, only the C content is not a GEMM).
//!
//! # Host arguments (byte counts, `waves = W`, `kc`)
//! * arg0 = A, **4 segments** of `W*kc*4096` B, segment `c = 0..4` is injected by column `c`. Inside a segment: wave,
//!   K chunk, one 4 KiB E/O half chunk (8 `mb_local` x 8 `kb` 8x8 blocks, [`Geometry::pack_a_half_chunk`]) of rows
//!   `w*256 + q*128 ..` with `q = c/2`, half `h = c%2`. A total is `4*W*kc*4096`. Columns 4..7 read no A.
//! * arg1 = B, **8 column segments** of `kc*10240` B (total `8*kc*10240`), chunk-major, per chunk `[even N tile 5120 B,
//!   odd N tile 5120 B]` = N tiles `2c`, `2c+1`; each 5120 B tile is `(kb 0..8, nb 0..10)` 8x8 blocks. B is read from DDR
//!   exactly once per submit, whatever `mw` is.
//! * arg2 = C, **8 column segments** of `W*4*10240` B (total `8*W*4*10240`): the S2MM0 stream (core rows 0, 1) followed
//!   by the S2MM1 stream (core rows 2, 3), each `(wave, rho % 2)` int8 tiles of 10240 B in `(mb 0..16, nb 0..10)` 8x8
//!   blocks ([`Geometry::pair_c_offset`]). For `K = 2560, M = 4096`: A 10 MiB, B 3.125 MiB, C 5 MiB.

//! Columns 4..7 have no A rows: 22 BDs and 18 locks there; columns 0..3 have the 26 BDs and 22 locks. Lock ids used:
//! `0..3` (A), `4`, `6` (B ready), `8..23` (C). Initial values: every `*_EMPTY` 1, every `*_FULL` 0, ready0 = ready1 = 0.
//! A ready lock never exceeds `kc <= 40 < 63`.
//!
//! ## B fill, guarded read, whole read (iteration contract)
//! Fill BD 4 / 5: base `0x1c000` / `0x1c000 + kc*5120`, 1280 words, iteration `step = 1280` words, `wrap = kc`,
//! `current = 0`; BD 4 links to BD 5, BD 5 has no `next`; the queued task repeats the chain `kc` times, so each BD is
//! loaded exactly `kc` times and its iteration `current` returns to 0 with the last load. Guard BD 30 / 42: same base,
//! length, iteration (`step = 1280, wrap = kc, current = 0`) and no `next`, task `repeat = kc`. Whole BD 31 / 43: same
//! base, `kc*1280` words, **default** iteration (`step 1, wrap 1`), no lock, no `next`, task `repeat = mw - 1`, queued
//! on the same channel strictly after the guard task (ordered queue, depth 2 of the memtile limit 4; `repeat <= 256`).
//! Reader chunk `j` therefore starts only after fill chunk `j` of its own parity landed
//! (`ready_p = fills_p - guarded reads_p`), and the unguarded whole pass starts only after the guard task consumed
//! all `kc` credits, so B is immutable afterwards and needs no lock. The two parity readers are independent queues.
//! All plain 1-D transfers, no dimension wrap (so a chunk of parity 1 can be read before all parity 0 chunks landed).
//!
//! # Completed-submit end state and lean repair recipe
//! Contract for a lean/persistent Railgun integration. "Start" is the canonical start state `S0` written by the full
//! dynamic TXN (`ArrayDesign::insts`): cores reset, every listed channel reset and queued at its first BD, **all G80
//! memtile BDs rewritten after the channel reset and before any queue write**, every lock at its initial value, shim
//! tokens armed. With `J = kc * waves` chunk transfers and `W = waves` tiles per column the end state of a submit whose C
//! token SYNCs (both S2MM channels, all 8 columns) returned is:
//! * **B fill S2MM4** (BD 4, 5, task `repeat = kc`): finite, idle, queue empty, **never parked**. `current` of BD 4 and BD 5
//!   returned to 0 (`kc` loads, `wrap = kc`). ready0 = ready1 = `kc - kc = 0`. There is no lookahead credit (finite tasks load
//!   no BD after the last repeat). Requeue is mandatory for every submit: `Task{S2mm, 4, BD 4, repeat = kc}`.
//! * **B readers MM2S1 / MM2S5**: guard task (`repeat = kc`) and whole task (`repeat = mw-1`) both finished, idle, queue
//!   empty; `current` of BD 30 / 42 is 0 again; BD 31 / 43 carry no iteration or lock. Requeue is mandatory for every submit,
//!   in this order on each channel: guard `repeat = kc`, then whole `repeat = mw - 1` only if `mw > 1`.
//! * **A fill S2MM5 {28,29} / A replay MM2S2 {14,15}** (cols 0..3): `J` loads each, parked at BD `28 + J%2` /
//!   `14 + J%2`; `A_FULL = 0`; the S2MM parked BD holds the lookahead acquire (`A_EMPTY[J%2] = 0`, the other slot's empty 1).
//!   Equivalent to S0 iff `J` is even. Minimal lean repair for odd `J` (slot 1): reset (CTRL bit1 pulse) both channels, restore only the
//!   dropped lookahead credit `A_EMPTY[1] = 1` (the canonical full reset writes every A lock to its initial value), requeue BD 28 / 14.
//! * **C producers S2MM0..3** (`{0,1}`, `{24,25}`, `{2,3}`, `{26,27}`) : `W` loads, parked at slot `W%2` with its empty-lock
//!   lookahead taken; **C drains MM2S0 / MM2S3**: `2W` loads, parked at BD `6 + 2*(W%2)` / `32 + 2*(W%2)`, full locks unacquired.
//!   Equivalent to S0 iff `W` is even. Minimal lean repair for odd `W` (parked at slot 1): reset all six channels (S2MM0..3, MM2S0,
//!   MM2S3), restore only the dropped slot-1 `EMPTY` lock of each row (`c_lock(1, r) = 1`), requeue BD `C_S2MM_BD[r][0]`, 6, 32.
//!   C rings use no iteration, so there is no `current` to repair.
//! * **Cores**: `DONE`; always halt+reset, `CORE_PC = 0`, enable last, as the full TXN. Canonical full reset reloads every core lock
//!   (`A/B_EMPTY = 1`, `C_EMPTY = 1`, rest 0); the minimal lean repair reloads only what the end state lost: the dropped pong
//!   `A_EMPTY[1]` / `B_EMPTY[1]` lookahead credit when `J` is odd (`C_EMPTY` stays 1, FULL and PEER locks are 0). Core S2MM0 (A)
//!   {0,1} / S2MM1 (B) {2,3} are parked at BD `J%2` (reset and requeue BD 0 / 2 when `J` is odd); core MM2S0 C (BD 4 self-cyclic)
//!   parks at BD 4 with `C_FULL` unacquired for any `W`.
//! * **Shim**: finite BDs/tasks consumed (shim channels are never reset); BDs are rewritten with new DDR patches each submit.
//! * **Streams**: no residue after the C tokens: the cores consume exactly `kc*W` A and B chunks, A/B shim BDs have drained,
//!   the C streams carry exactly `W*2*10240` B per channel; every switch lane is empty.
//!
//! A lean TXN is valid **only** directly after a *completed* submit (both aggregate C SYNCs returned). After an interrupted or
//! aborted run the state above does not hold and only the canonical full reset is valid: full channel resets, a rewrite of
//! every G80 memtile BD (clearing the `current` of BD 4, 5, 30, 42, which a channel reset does not clear), and initialisation of
//! every lock. After a completed submit a lean TXN, for every column, requeues the finite B fill / guard / whole tasks (above,
//! `repeat = kc` for fill and guard, `mw - 1` for whole) and applies only the parity repairs listed (`J` odd: A / core rings; `W`
//! odd: C rings / drains). The ready locks 4 and 6 end at 0 and the completed finite fill holds **no** lookahead credit, so no lock
//! write is needed for them: a forced reset of S2MM4 (POLL) or MM2S0 (DONE) by the lean ring does not touch locks 4 / 6 and needs no
//! lock repair, only the requeue of BD 4 with `repeat = kc` (retain `kc`) and of all B tasks, and BD 6 for MM2S0 (valid only while
//! the drain chain is parked at BD 6, i.e. `W` even; for odd `W` the parity plan above already resets and requeues it). Ring
//! scratch X / Y are never touched (`[0, 0x4000)`).
//! A submit must start only after the previous submit's two aggregate C SYNCs returned (quiescent array) and the next
//! expert's B is not overlapped with the previous submit: the B regions are single buffered per submit.
//!
//! # Shim (DDR patch points, built by `gemm_array`)
//! Per column: BD 0 B on MM2S0 (`kc*2560` words, arg1 + `col*kc*10240`), BD 1 C stream 0 on S2MM0 (`W*5120` words, arg2 +
//! `col*W*40960`, token), BD 2 A on MM2S1 (columns 0..3 only, `W*kc*1024` words, arg0 + `col*W*kc*4096`), BD 3 C stream 1 on
//! S2MM1 (`W*5120` words, arg2 + `col*W*40960 + W*2*10240`, token). Each BD's address word (`Bd::address(shim, id) + 4`)
//! is DDR-patched with `column_offset (+ arena_base[arg])` in the grouped launch.
//!
//! # Switch circuits (column `c`, lanes preserved, no master has two slaves)
//! * shim: MM2S0 -> North0 (B), MM2S1 -> North1 (A, columns 0..3), North0 -> S2MM0 and North1 -> S2MM1 (C).
//! * memtile: South0 -> Dma4 (B fill); South1 -> Dma5 and Dma2 -> North5 (A, columns 0..3); Dma1 -> North4 (parity 0 B);
//!   Dma5 -> North3 (parity 1 B); North(r) -> Dma(r) (C of core row r, r = 0..3); Dma0 -> South0 (rows 0, 1 drain); Dma3 -> South1
//!   (rows 2, 3 drain).
//! * core row `r`: C `Dma0 -> South(r)` and `North(s) -> South(s)` for `s > r`. B parity 0 on lane 4: `South4 -> Dma1` on rows 0, 2,
//!   `South4 -> North4` on rows 0, 1. B parity 1 on lane 3: `South3 -> Dma1` on rows 1, 3, `South3 -> North3` on rows 0, 1, 2.
//!   A of row `r` is injected by column `r` (columns 0..3) on North5, passed `South5 -> North5` by rows below `r`, selected at row `r`
//!   as `South5` (column `r`), `East0` (columns `< r`) or `West0` (columns `> r`), driving `Dma0`, `West0` (`0 < col <= r`) and
//!   `East0` (`col < 7`, `col >= r`), so every column of the row receives the same half.
