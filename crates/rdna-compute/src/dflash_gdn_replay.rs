//! Railgun E0 / L6c: `Gpu` launchers for the multi-layer DFlash/MTP GDN
//! replay (gfx1201).
//!
//! `GdnTape::replay_gdn` advances every LinearAttention layer's conv ring and
//! recurrent state by `n_steps` tokens from the verify tape. Layers are
//! independent, so the per-layer launch sequence (conv1d + QK norm +
//! interleave + GDN: 4 launches x 48 layers on gfx1201) collapses to two
//! launches over a device pointer table with one row per layer:
//!
//! 1. [`Gpu::dflash_gdn_replay_pre_ml`] — the `dflash_gdn_pre_replay_gfx1100`
//!    preamble body per (block, layer), grid.y = layer.
//! 2. [`Gpu::gated_delta_net_q8_fast_ml`] — `gated_delta_net_q8_fast` built
//!    with the shipping defines plus `HIPFIRE_GDN_LAYER_TABLE`, grid.z =
//!    layer, frames reserved exactly as the per-layer launches would.
//!
//! Railgun D8 adds `_from` twins of both kernels (`DFLASH_GDN_REPLAY_STATE_SRC`
//! / `HIPFIRE_GDN_STATE_SRC`): the same bodies with the recurrent-state loads
//! redirected to a second table column, so the DFlash rollback replays from
//! the snapshot buffers into the live ones instead of restoring first.
//!
//! Both kernels read pointers from device memory, so a Redline tape could
//! not attribute their effects; the launchers therefore decline (return
//! `Ok(false)`) while a Redline recording is open. HipGraph capture is fine
//! (`launch_maybe_blob`). The pointer tables are owned by the caller.
