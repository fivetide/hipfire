// Concurrent serve: several agents served at once by the multi-slot engine.
//
// `hipfire serve` already exposes an OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions
// over HTTP, and HTTP is already concurrent. What serialises requests today is
// behind it: one `Engine` (a single daemon process) guarded by a
// `Mutex<ServeRuntime>`. `SlotEngine` is an alternative backend that lives
// OUTSIDE that mutex — which is the entire point — so requests overlap.

// The engine LOOP lives in `hipfire-arch-qwen35::serve_engine`, not here:
// it needs `forward_batch_slots_graphed`, and that crate already depends on
// this one, so putting the loop here would be a dependency cycle. This module
// owns the protocol types both sides share — the same layering reason
// `swap::snapshot` takes an opaque buffer slice instead of a `DeltaNetState`.
