//! The architecture-agnostic view of a loaded model.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! `hipfire_loader::ModelState` is a closed enum with one variant per
//! architecture. Every crate that needed a scalar off a loaded model therefore
//! had to name all eleven — including the product entry point, which computed
//! *three integers* through a seven-arm architecture dispatch:
//!
//! ```text
//! let (dim, layers, vocab) = match m.state.as_ref() {
//!     Some(ModelState::Qwen35(b)) => (b.config.dim,         b.config.n_layers,          b.config.vocab_size),
//!     Some(ModelState::Qwen2(b))  => (b.config.hidden_size, b.config.num_hidden_layers, b.config.vocab_size),
//!     …
//! ```
//!
//! Seven arms, one tuple, and the only real difference is that some configs
//! spell it `dim`/`n_layers` and others `hidden_size`/`num_hidden_layers`. A
//! naming inconsistency was being paid for with architecture dispatch in the
//! daemon.
//!
//! Measured before this trait existed: the loader and daemon between them held
//! 93 `ModelState::` references, but touched only **seven distinct members** of
//! the bundles they unwrapped — `config` (26 hits, only ever for those three
//! scalars), `state`, `reset_session_state`, `kv_cache`/`kv`, `dn_state` (since
//! deleted as vestigial) and `weights` (free-on-unload). That is the whole
//! surface, and it is what this trait exposes.
//!
//! ## Why it lives in `hipfire-runtime`
//!
//! `hipfire-loader` depends on every `hipfire-arch-*` crate; the arch crates
//! must not depend on the loader. A trait that arch crates implement and the
//! loader consumes therefore cannot live in the loader — that is a cycle. It
//! also cannot live in `saddle-core`, which sits below the runtime and must not
//! know about `KvCache`. `hipfire-runtime` is the one layer both sides already
//! depend on, so it is where the contract belongs.
//!
//! ## What this is NOT
//!
//! Not a forward-pass abstraction. Generation stays in `hipfire-generate`,
//! which is the architecture composition root by design and legitimately names
//! arch crates. This trait exists so that *infrastructure* — load
//! acknowledgement, session reset, unload — stops branching on architecture.
