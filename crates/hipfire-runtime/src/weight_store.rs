//! `fulfill_manifest` — the GPU execution of a weight-placement plan (Phase 2
//! of the device-mesh plan, the "how" on top of the pure "where" in
//! [`crate::weight_manifest`]).
//!
//! [`crate::weight_manifest::plan_manifest`] already computes, deterministically
//! and on the CPU, *where every weight lands* (`placement = manifest × mesh`).
//! `fulfill_manifest` is the thin GPU driver that reads each tensor's bytes and
//! uploads them to the devices that plan names, returning a [`WeightStore`] —
//! the load-side *placement container* keyed by `(logical_name, layer, device)`, whose
//! value is a [`WeightHandle`] (`Resident` GPU tensor or a same-device `Alias`
//! of another entry). See docs/…/2026-07-05-device-mesh-transparent-parallelism.md §4.
//!
//! **Scope.** Implemented placements: *whole-tensor upload* (single-GPU + all of
//! PP + every `Replicate`/`Pin`/`Tied`, and any sharding policy that degenerates
//! to a size-1 group); *expert-parallel `ExpertSharded`* on an `Ep>1` mesh (each
//! rank a compact blob of its owned experts — generic expert-outermost gather);
//! and dense tensor-parallel **`ColumnShard{axis:0}`** (PB-1a — contiguous
//! output-row split, format-agnostic) + **`RowShard`** (PB-1c — strided per-row
//! k-gather). Still returning a clear [`FulfillError`] at `Tp>1`: `FusedQkv` /
//! `HeadSharded` / `VocabShard` (and non-axis-0 `Column`) — the head-aware /
//! vocab gathers of PB-1b; refusing beats silently mis-placing.
//!
//! **Why a `source` closure, not `&HfqFile`.** A [`WeightEntry`] names tensors
//! *logically* (`"wq"`, `"ffn_down"`); the on-disk HFQ names are arch-specific
//! (prefix variants, GGUF `blk.N.*`). Reading them is the arch's knowledge, not
//! the engine's — so the caller passes a `source(entry) -> (raw bytes, dtype)`
//! closure (backed by its HFQ + name resolver), keeping the engine free of
//! on-disk naming. The dtype is the tensor's **real** on-disk quant type
//! (`Q4F16G64`/`MQ4`/`Q8_0`/`F16`/`F32`), so the placed tensor is forward-ready
//! (the right kernel dispatches), not an opaque `Raw` blob. This *pulls
//! complexity to the arch* and preserves the Tier-1 rule that the engine drives
//! placement without naming a device or an on-disk tensor. (The plan sketches
//! `fulfill_manifest(manifest, hfq, mesh)`; the source closure is the same shape
//! with the name-resolution seam made explicit.)
