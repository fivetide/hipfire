//! Execution scopes, condition handles and loops (design §4.6-§4.7).
//!
//! - `Workgroup`: workgroup-uniform control. Barriers, LDS layout,
//!   `loop_carried`, `wg_skip_if`, kernel exits and the wave-role `handoff`
//!   live here. It dereferences to `Wave`.
//! - `Wave`: one wave's program. LDS stores/loads, waits, raw ISA, and
//!   wave-uniform scopes (`skip_if`, `exec_if`, `if_else`, `loop_until`)
//!   whose bodies see only a `Wave`, so a barrier under wave- or
//!   lane-dependent control does not compile.
//!
//! A `Workgroup` owns its backend for one session (`backend::Auth`): the
//! backend refuses a second `Workgroup::new`, so a wave scope cannot
//! rebuild a workgroup scope from `Wave::isa`, and raw access through
//! `isa` cannot reach the authorized LDS, barrier, branch and loop entry
//! points.
//!
//! Every place two control paths meet (a skip target, an `if_else` join, a
//! loop exit) joins the backend state of every path into it
//! (`Backend::join`): waits and hazard guards hold on each path, and paths
//! that disagree on LDS ownership are refused.
//!
//! Conditions are affine handles: `Uniform<Scc>` (wave-uniform, from any
//! scalar compare) and `WgUniform<Scc>` (workgroup-uniform). A handle is
//! consumed by exactly one branch and refused if SCC was redefined since
//! its compare. In M0 register values are pinned (hand register plans keep
//! byte identity), so the workgroup uniformity of a compare's operands is
//! the caller's claim at `Workgroup::scmp_wg_uniform`, not a derivation.
