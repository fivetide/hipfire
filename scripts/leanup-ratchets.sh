# Ratchets for docs/governance/2026-08-15-hipfire-leanup-map.md § 4.
#
# Run from the repository root.
#
# Metrics listed in scripts/leanup-thresholds.txt are ASSERTED: a violation
# exits non-zero. Everything else is reported and never fails the run.
# `--report` prints without asserting.
#
# Until 2026-08-16 this script emitted 22 metrics and contained exactly one
# `exit 1`, on the `cd` guard. Its header said "every number is measured, never
# asserted", and it was believed to be a gate anyway.
#
# On the compute:arch ratio — read this before quoting it
# -------------------------------------------------------
# The original ratchet counted `.rs` files in eight compute crates and
# compared the result against llama.cpp's `ggml/`. That is not a like-for-like
# comparison: `ggml/` is almost entirely kernel source (.c/.cpp/.cu/.metal/
# .cl/.comp), while hipfire's equivalent — `kernels/`, ~120k lines of HIP —
# was excluded from its own compute side. The leanup map's § 6 explicitly
# names "the kernel family" as part of the compute layer, so excluding it
# contradicted the very definition being measured.
#
# This script reports the ratio three ways so the rule is visible rather than
# buried:
#
#   crates-only   what the original ratchet measured. Kept for continuity
#                 with the historical figure; not a fair comparison.
#   all-kernels   every kernel line on the compute side, which is the rule
#                 `ggml/` is measured under.
#   strict        arch-named kernels (deepseek4_*, fused_gemma4_*, …) moved
#                 to the arch side. llama.cpp has zero model-named files in
#                 `ggml/` — verified.
#   +substrate    strict, plus the engine substrate. SECOND measurement defect:
#                 the compute list below was written before the saddle layering
#                 existed and was never updated, so `saddle-core`,
#                 `hipfire-engine` and `hipfire-dispatch` — which carry ZERO
#                 `hipfire_arch_*` references and ZERO arch Cargo deps, and so
#                 cannot be arch code under any reading — were counted on
#                 NEITHER side. llama.cpp's analogue (`src/` minus
#                 `src/models/`: llama-context, llama-kv-cache, llama-batch,
#                 llama-sampling) is 53,974 lines and is likewise not arch.
#                 Quote THIS one; it is the conservative figure.
#   +dispatchers  also counts hipfire-runtime/loader/generate, which reference
#                 arch only to dispatch into it, exactly as llama.cpp's
#                 `llama-model.cpp` switches over `LLM_ARCH_*`. Upper bound.
#
# Measured llama.cpp for calibration (see docs/governance): ggml:src/models is
# 16.20 : 1 and (ggml+substrate):src/models is 19.19 : 1. The 9.7 : 1 figure
# quoted in the original grounding doc could not be reproduced from the tree.

# [[example]] block. An earlier version counted required-features LINES per
# manifest and reported 16 where the answer was 32; a metric that is wrong is
